{"question": "True about simple randomization is: March 2011", "exp": "Ans. A: Every person has an equal chance of selection In simple random sampling, every unit of population has equal chances of being selected Randomized controlled trial (RCT) It is a type of scientific experiment - a form of clinical trial - most commonly used in testing the safety (or more specifically, information about adverse drug reactions and adverse effects of other treatments) and efficacy or effectiveness of healthcare services (such as medicine or nursing) or health technologies (such as pharmaceuticals, medical devices or surgery). The key distinguishing feature of the usual RCT is that study subjects, after assessment of eligibility and recruitment, but before the intervention to be studied begins, are randomly allocated to receive one or other of the alternative treatments under study. Random allocation in real trials is complex, but conceptually, the process is like tossing a coin. After randomization, the two (or more) groups of subjects are followed up in exactly the same way, and the only differences between the care they receive, for example, in terms of procedures, tests, outpatient visits, follow-up calls etc. should be those intrinsic to the treatments being compared. The most impoant advantage of proper randomization is that it minimizes allocation bias, balancing both known and unknown prognostic factors, in the assignment of treatments.\" The advantages of proper randomization in RCTs include: \"It eliminates bias in treatment assignment,\" specifically selection bias and confounding. \"It facilitates blinding (masking) of the identity of treatments from investigators, paicipants, and assessors.\" \"It permits the use of probability theory to express the likelihood that any difference in outcome between treatment groups merely indicates chance. There are two processes involved in randomizing patients to different interventions. First is choosing a randomization procedure to generate an unpredictable sequence of allocations; this may be a simple random assignment of patients to any of the groups at equal probabilities, may be \"restricted,\" or may be \"adaptive.\" A second and more practical issue is allocation concealment, which refers to the stringent precautions taken to ensure that the group assignment of patients are not revealed prior to definitively allocating them to their respective groups. Non-random \"systematic\" methods of group assignment, such as alternating subjects between one group and the other, can cause \"limitless contamination possibilities\" and can cause a breach of allocation concealment. Randomization procedures An ideal randomization procedure would achieve the following goals: Equal group sizes for adequate statistical power, especially in subgroup analyses. Low selection bias. That is, the procedure should not allow an investigator to predict the next subject's group assignment by examining which group has been assigned the fewest subjects up to that point. Low probability of confounding (i.e., a low probability of \"accidental bias\"), which implies a balance in covariates across groups. Simple randomization: This is a commonly used and intuitive procedure, similar to \"repeated fair coin-tossing.\" Also known as \"complete\" or \"unrestricted\" randomization, it is robust against both selection and accidental biases. However, its main drawback is the possibility of imbalanced group sizes in small RCTs. It is therefore recommended only for RCTs with over 200 subjects. Restricted randomization: To balance group sizes in smaller RCTs, some form of \"restricted\" randomization is recommended. The major types of restricted randomization used in RCTs are: Permuted-block randomization or blocked randomization: a \"block size\" and \"allocation ratio\" (number of subjects in one group versus the other group) are specified, and subjects are allocated randomly within each block.

{"question": "A 56-year-old man is evaluated for recent onset painful skin lesion which involves his abdominal wall. The lesion started 3 days ago as a small erythematous macule which has gradually increased in size to a large purpuric lesion with bulla formation. He is afebrile and does not recall any trauma. His medical history is significant for atrial fibrillation; he was recently switched from rivaroxaban to warfarin due to the high cost of rivaroxaban.What is the most probable cause of the condition?", "exp": "Malignancy is a recognized risk factor for venous thromboembolism (VTE), and VTE is the second leading cause of death in cancer patients. Procoagulant molecules expressed both by cancer cells and host tissue contribute to this condition. Low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) is the preferred anticoagulant for long-term treatment in patients with cancer. When compared with warfarin, LMWH reduces the rate of recurrent VTE without significant risk of bleeding. Newer anticoagulants such as rivaroxaban have not been adequately tested for cancer-induced VTE yet.Young patients with unprovoked VTE, a history of unexplained VTE, or family history of VTE raise the suspicion of an inherited hypercoagulable disorder. The common inherited hypercoagulable disorders are Factor V Leiden mutation, prothrombin gene mutation, protein S deficiency, protein C deficiency, antithrombin III deficiency, dysfibrinogenemia, and antiphospholipid antibody syndrome. When inherited hypercoagulable disorders are strongly suspected, tests for above mentioned disorders can be ordered. In the event of an acute thrombosis, however, it is not recommended to test for protein C, protein S, and anti-thrombin III since active coagulation can reduce the plasma concentration of these proteins resulting in false-positive result. To avoid confusion, it is recommended to order only Factor V Leiden mutation, prothrombin gene mutation, and antiphospholipid antibody with acute VTE or when patients are on warfarin.Warfarin-induced skin necrosis results from a transient hypercoagulable state. Warfarin initially affects all the vitamin K-dependent clotting proteins (Factors II, VII, IX, X, and proteins C and S). Since Protein C has a short half-life (8-12 hours), the serum protein C concentration drops quickly to 50% of normal in first 24 hours. Since circulating levels of other vitamin K-dependent proteins are still high, this gives rise to a hypercoagulable state which may cause microthrombi in the dermal and subcutaneous vessels, resulting in skin necrosis. The risk is particularly high in case of congenital protein C deficiency; nearly one-third cases of warfarin-induced skin necrosis are associated with congenital protein C deficiency.", "cop": 3, "opa": "Rivaroxaban", "opb": "Low-molecular-weight heparin", "opc": "Warfarin", "opd": "Low dose aspirin (81 mg/d)", "subject_name": "Medicine", "topic_name": "Oncology", "id": "e8f10d54-2bca-4eba-94fa-4261cf6623f3", "choice_type": "multi", "temporal_label": "Acute"}

{"question": "Process of coating of pathogen for efficient phagocytosis is known as: September 2011", "exp": "Ans. D: Opsonization Phagocytosis is largely responsible for depletion of cells coated with antibodies Cells opsonized by the IgG antibodies are recognized by phagocyte Fc receptors, which are specific for the Fc poions of some IgG subclasses Agglutination When a paiculate antigen is mixed with its antibody in the presence of electrolytes at a suitable temperature and pH, the paicles are clumped or agglutinated Transduction Transfer of a poion of the DNA from one bacterium to another by a bacteriophage Conjugation It is .a process by whereby a 'male' or 'donor' bacterium 'mates' or makes a physical contact with a 'female' or 'recipient' bacterium and transfers genetic element into it Opsonization It is the process by which a pathogen is marked for ingestion and destruction by a phagocyte. Opsonization involves the binding of an opsonin, e.g., antibody, to a receptor on the pathogen's cell membrane. After opsonin binds to the membrane, phagocytes are attracted to the pathogen. The Fab poion of the antibody binds to the antigen, whereas the Fc poion of the antibody binds to an Fc receptor on the phagocyte, facilitating phagocytosis. The receptor-opsin complex can also create byproducts like C3b and C4b which are impoant components of the complement system. These components are deposited on the cell surface of the pathogen and aid in its destruction. The cell can also be destroyed by a process called antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity, in which the pathogen does not need to be phagocytosed to be destroyed. During this process, the pathogen is opsonized and bound with the antibody IgG its Fab domain. Then the antibody binds an immune effector cell its Fc domain and this binding triggers a release of lysis products from the bound immune effector cell (monocytes, neutrophils, eosinophils and natural killer cells). This process can cause inflammation of surrounding tissues and damage to healthy cells. Opsonin It is any molecule that targets an antigen for an immune response. However, the term is usually used in reference to molecules that act as a binding enhancer for the process of phagocytosis, especially antibodies, which coat the negatively-charged molecules on the membrane. Molecules that activate the complement system are also considered opsonins. Phagocytic cells do not have an FC receptor for IgM, making IgM ineffective in assisting phagocytosis. However, IgM is extremely efficient at activating complement and is, therefore, considered an opsonin. Opsonins can also refer to molecules that target a cell for destruction through the action of Natural Killer cells. Examples of opsonin molecules include: Antibodies: IgG Components of the complement system: C3b, C4b, and iC3b Mannose-binding lectin (initiates the formation of C3b) The most impoant are IgG and C3b.", "cop": 4, "opa": "Agglutination", "opb": "Transduction", "opc": "Conjugation", "opd": "Opsonization", "subject_name": "Microbiology", "topic_name": null, "id": "dbc859b3-4934-4650-bfdf-73ea3894b7cd", "choice_type": "single", "temporal_label": "None"}
{"question": "Which of the following is associated with leprosy: September 2005", "exp": "Ans. D: All of the above Histologic findings vary according to the type of leprosy. Indeterminate leprosy is characterized by a few cells cuffing the dermal appendages and neurovascular bundles and a few M leprae within cutaneous nerves. In TT leprosy, epithelioid cells, lymphocytes, and perhaps giant cells form noncaseating granulomas. Dermal nerves are destroyed. Normal skin organs (e.g., sweat glands, hair follicles) are lost. Bacilli are frequently absent or difficult to demonstrate. In LL leprosy, the epidermis is normal and the rete flattened. A clear space separates the epidermis from diffuse granulomatous reaction with macrophages; large, foamy histiocytes (Virchow or lepra cells); and many intracellular AFB, which are frequently found in spheroidal masses (i.e., globi). Epithelioid cells and giant cells are not found. Granulomas are most numerous around blood vessels, nerves, and skin appendages. In some cases, many plasma cells are found. Dermal nerves are easily visible. In BT leprosy, granulomas are epithelioid, with a preponderance of lymphocytes. Dermal nerves are mostly destroyed. Bacilli may be scanty or absent. In BB leprosy, granulomas are epithelioid, dermal nerves may be visible, and bacilli are seen more often than in BT leprosy. In BL leprosy, histiocytes form granulomas, dermal nerves are visible, and bacilli are seen in greater numbers than in other types. In a reversal reaction, epithelioid cells and lymphocytes form granulomas. Extracellular edema is noted in the collagen of the dermis with dilated lymphatics or a proliferation of fibrocytes. As reactions clear, lesions heal with reduction or eradication of bacilli. ENL reaction is characterized by a massive influx of polymorphonuclear cells. Complement and immunoglobulin may be deposited in a granular pattern around dermal vessels. Bacilli become more numerous.

Because of the extra chromosome, individuals with the condition are usually referred to as \"XXY Males\", or \"47, XXY Males\" Klinefelter syndrome is the most common sex chromosome disorder in males and the second most common condition caused by the presence of extra chromosomes. The condition exists in roughly 1 out of every 500-650 males but many of these people may not show symptoms. Principal effects include hypogonadism and reduced feility. Turner syndrome/Ullrich-Turner syndrome/Gonadal dysgenesis It encompasses several conditions in human females, of which monosomy X (absence of an entire sex chromosome, the Barr body) is most common. It is a chromosomal abnormality in which all or pa of one of the sex chromosomes is absent (unaffected humans have 46 chromosomes, of which two are sex chromosomes). Normal females have two X chromosomes, but in Turner syndrome, one of those sex chromosomes is missing or has other abnormalities. In some cases, the chromosome is missing in some cells but not others, a condition referred to as mosaicism or 'Turner mosaicism'. Occurring in 1 in 2000 -1 in 5000 phenotypic females. There are characteristic physical abnormalities, such as Sho stature, Broad chest, - Low hairline, - Low-set ears, and - Webbed necks. Girls with Turner syndrome typically experience gonadal dysfunction (non-working ovaries), which results in amenorrhea (absence of menstrual cycle) and sterility. Concurrent health concerns are also frequently present, including congenital hea disease, hypothyroidism, diabetes, vision problems, hearing concerns, and many autoimmune diseases. Finally, a specific pattern of cognitive deficits is often observed, with paicular difficulties in visuospatial, mathematical, and memory areas Down syndrome/trisomy 21 Down syndrome is a chromosomal condition characterized by the presence of an extra copy of genetic material on the 21st chromosome, either in whole (trisomy 21) or pa (such as due to translocations). The incidence of Down syndrome is estimated at 1 per 733 bihs It is statistically more common with older parents due to increased mutagenic exposures upon some older parents' reproductive cells. Down syndrome is associated with some impairment of cognitive ability and physical growth, and a paicular set of facial characteristics. Individuals with Down syndrome tend to have a lower-than-average cognitive ability, often ranging from mild to moderate disabilities. The average IQ of children with Down syndrome is around 50, compared to normal children with an IQ of 100.

The treatment of choice is:", "exp": "Treatment of rectal cancer: Surgical and oncological management varies greatly depending on the stage of the tumor within the rectum. Superficially invasive, small cancers may be managed effectively with local excision. However, most patients have more deeply invasive tumors that require major surgery, such as low anterior resection or abdominoperineal resection. Low anterior resection: This is a sphincter saving procedure. In this procedure the sigmoid colon and proximal rectum are removed. The descending colon is anastomosed to the distal rectum. Previously this sphincter saving LAR procedure was possible for lesions confined in upper ? rd of rectum. Lesions in lower third were treated with APR with permanent colostomy. With the introduction of stapling gun, the sphincter saving LAR operation can now be done even in lesions of lower ? of rectum, provided a margin of 2 cm or more of normal bowel can be resected below the lesions but above the dentate line. 1 cm of margins can be adequate, provided the carcinoma is well differentiated. Abdominoperineal resection (also known as Miles procedure): In this procedure there is complete excision of the distal sigmoid colon, rectum and anus, by the concomitant dissection through the abdomen and perineum with creation of permanent colostomy. APR is performed when adequate distal margins for LAR cannot be obtained i.e. for carcinoma in lower rectum. Local excision: In carefully selected patients with small, well differentiated, superficial, mobile polypoid lesions, a full thickness excision can be performed through the transrectal route as the definitive therapy. Local excision can be done for selected T1 and T2 lesions without evidence of nodal disease. Palliative procedures: unresectable rectal cancers can be palliated by fulguration (electrocoagulation) or laser photocoagulation. Chemoradiation: Chemoradiation can be given as adjuvant or neoadjuvant therapy. \"In this patient the tumor lies 3.5 cms above the anal verge (the lower limit is taken into consideration). Dentate line is just 2 cms from the anl verge so the tumor is just 1.5 cm from the dentate line.

{"question": "Enteric fever diagnosis in 2nd week is best made by: September 2012", "exp": "Ans. B i.e. Widal test Widal test It is a presumptive serological test for enteric fever or undulant fever whereby bacteria causing typhoid fever are mixed with serum containing specific antibodies obtained from an infected individual. In case of Salmonella infections, it is a demonstration of the presence of 0-soma false-positive result. Test results need to be interpreted carefully in the light of past history of enteric fever, typhoid vaccination, and the general level of antibodies in the populations in endemic areas of the world. As with all serological tests, the rise in antibody levels needed to perform the diagnosis takes 7-14 days, which limits it applicability in early diagnosis. Other means of diagnosing Salmonella typhi (and paratyphi) include cultures of blood, urine and faeces. These organisms produce H2S from thiosulfate and can be easily identified on differential media such as Bismuth sulfite agar. Often 2-mercaptoethanol is added to the Widal test. This agent more easily denatures the IgM class of antibodies, so if a decrease in the titer is seen after using this agent, it means that the contribution of IgM has been removed leaving the IgG component. This differentiation of antibody classes is impoant; as it allows for the distinction of a recent (IgM) from an old infection (IgG). The Widal test is positive if TO antigen titer is more than 1:160 in an active infection, or if TH antigen titer is more than 1:160 in past infection or in immunized persons.

However, MOPP may be used if there are lung or hea conditions present or allergies to any of the medications in the ABVD combination.

Hypersecretion of thyroid hormone because of stimulation of the TSH receptor by thyroid-stimulating immunoglobulins results in excessive movement of thyroglobulin from the colloid to the plasma. The presence of exophthalmos is thought to be pa of the autoimmune disorder in Graves' disease. It is postulated that the thyroid and orbital muscles may share a common antigen. Lymphocytic infiltration and inflammation of orbital muscle then produces the ophthalmopathy. Serum T4 is increased in Graves' disease. Because of excessive stimulation of the thyroid by the thyroid stimulating immunoglobulins, radioactive iodine uptake, which assesses iodine trapping, is increased. The increase in free T4 due to hypersecretion by the thyroid shifts the equilibrium between free and bound T4 toward an increase in thyroxine binding globulin (TBG)-bound hormone. Concomitantly, the concentration of unbound TBG falls. Hence, the radioactive T3 in the resin T3 uptake test would preferentially bind to the resin and resin uptake would be increased.

Enlargement of the ventricles with increased cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) pressure is found, and therapeutic lumbar punctures may significantly improve symptoms. Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease is a rare diffuse degenerative disease that usually affects people in their 50s, and the usual course is about one year. The terminal stage is characterized by severe dementia, generalized hypeonicity, and profound speech disturbances. It is one of several diseases presumably caused by prions. Huntington disease is a hereditary disease associated with progressive degeneration of the basal ganglia and the cerebral coex. It is transmitted in an autosomal dominant pattern. The onset of Huntington disease occurs between 35 and 50 years of age, or later in rare cases. This disease is characterized by progressive dementia, muscular hypeonicity, and bizarre choreiform movements. Parkinson disease is characterized primarily by motor dysfunction, but dementia may be a pa of the disorder. The characteristic motor symptoms (bradykinesia, flat facies, resting tremor, shuffling gait, etc) are caused by degeneration of the nigrostriatal dopaminergic tract.

However, early in an infection, this antigen may not be present and it may be undetectable later in the infection as it is being cleared by the host. Anti-HBc IgM The infectious virion contains an inner \"core paicle\" enclosing viral genome. The icosahedral core paicle is made of 180 or 240 copies of core protein, alternatively known as hepatitis B core antigen, or HBcAg. During this 'window' in which the host remains infected but is successfully clearing the virus, IgM antibodies to the hepatitis B core antigen (anti-HBc IgM) may be the only serological evidence of disease. HbeAg and anti-HBe Sholy after the appearance of the HBsAg, the hepatitis B e antigen (HBeAg) will appear. Traditionally, the presence of HBeAg in a host's serum is associated with much higher rates of viral replication and enhanced infectivity During the natural course of an infection, the HBeAg may be cleared, and antibodies to the 'e' antigen (anti-HBe) will arise immediately afterwards. This conversion is usually associated with a dramatic decline in viral replication. Anti-HBs and anti-HBc IgG If the host is able to clear the infection, eventually the HBsAg will become undetectable and will be followed by IgG antibodies to the hepatitis B surface antigen and core antigen, (anti-HBs and anti HBc IgG). The time between the removal of the HBsAg and the appearance of anti-HBs is called the window period. A person negative for HBsAg but positive for anti-HBs has either cleared an infection or has been vaccinated previously. Hepatitis B carriers Individuals who remain HBsAg positive for at least six months are considered to be hepatitis B carriers. Carriers of the virus may have chronic hepatitis B, which would be reflected by elevated serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT) levels and inflammation of the liver, as revealed by biopsy. Carriers who have seroconveed to HBeAg negative status, paicularly those who acquired the infection as adults, have very little viral multiplication and hence may be at little risk of long-term complications or of transmitting infection to others. PCR tests They have been developed to detect and measure the amount of HBV DNA, called the viral load, in clinical specimens. These tests are used to assess a person's infection status and to monitor treatment. Individuals with high viral loads, characteristically have ground glass hepatocytes on biopsy.", "cop": 2, "opa": "Presence of HBeAg in serum", "opb": "Presence of IgM anti-HBc in serum", "opc": "Presence of HBsAg in serum", "opd": "Presence of IgG anti-HBc in serum", "subject_name": "Pathology", "topic_name": null, "id": "94e47beb-3052-4665-bdb2-151b9628a927", "choice_type": "single", "temporal_label": "Acute"}

In addition, thromboembolic phenomena may be seen in the pulmonary and systemic arteries and particularly in the cerebral vasculature; vascular occlusive disease is, in turn, one of the many causes of acute infantile hemiplegia. None of the other disorders listed in the question is associated with acute hemiplegia. Phenylketonuria causes retardation and, on occasion, seizures; maple syrup urine disease, an abnormality of the metabolism of leucine, leads to seizures and rapid deterioration of the CNS in newborn infants; and histidinemia and cystathioninuria are most likely a benign aminoaciduria with no effect on the CNS.

However, there is now a trend to replace the CFT with the simple flocculation tests. Although CFT is considered to be a relatively simple test, it is a very exacting procedure because 5 variables are involved. In essence the test consists of two antigen-antibody reactions, one of which is the indicator system. The first reaction, between a known virus antigen and a specific antibody takes place in the presence of a predetermined amount of complement. The complement is removed or \"fixed\" by the antigen-antibody complex. The second antigen-antibody reaction consists of reacting sheep RBC with haemolysin. When this indicator system is added to the reactants, the sensitized RBCs will only lyse in the presence of free complement. The antigens used for CFT tend to be group antigens rather than type-specific antigens. In order for the CFT to be set up correctly, the optimal concentration of haemolytic serum, complement, and antigen should be determined by titration.

PID refers to an upper genital tract infection, especially of the endosalpingeal cells that line the fallopian tubes. When the infection involves the fallopian tubes only, it is referred to as a salpingitis. When it involves the ovaries as well, it is then referred to as a salpingo-oophoritis. The endometrium is also often involved (endometritis). The peak incidence of the disease is in the 15- to 24-year-old-group. This patient presents with the typical symptoms of PID, paicularly abdominal/pelvic pain. Fever and vaginal discharge are often present in gonococcal PID, but may be absent in other forms of PID.

{"question": "The number of girls a woman would bear if she passes through her reproductive age with the same feility rate gives: March 2009", "exp": "Ans. C: Gross reproductive rate The net reproduction rate (NRR) measures the effective feility in a population, taking account not only of bihs but also of the fact that not all women born will survive to their own reproductive years. The NRR is the average number of daughters of reproductive age that a woman would have if she experienced over her lifetime the prevailing age-specific rates of feility and if her daughters experienced the prevailing rates of moality. The gross reproduction rate (GRR) for a paicular year is the average number of daughters that a woman would have if she experienced over her lifetime the age-specific feility rates of that year. In that it refers only to the number of daughters born to women, not the total number of children, it is a special case of the (period) total feility rate; in most circumstances (unless the sex ratio at bih is highly unequal) the GRR equals roughly half the TFR. The general feility rate is similar to the crude bih rate except that it uses a more restricted denominator, the female population of childbearing age, ages 15 to 49. Age-specific feility rates (also called age-specific bih rates) are similar to the crude bih rate but are calculated for specific age groups of women of childbearing age. The range of childbearing ages is conventionally considered to be ages 15 to 49 (sometimes 15 to 44 is used), and a full set of age-specific feility rates would span this interval-usually either in single-year age groups or, more commonly, in five-year groups: 15 to 19, 20 to 24, ..., 45 to 49. Marital feility rates can be calculated either for the full range of reproductive ages (15 to 49 or 15 to 44) or as age-specific rates.

This test is earliest sensitive test to diagnose diabetic nephropathy as albuminuria is the earliest manifestation of diabetic nephropathy. Abnormal levels of the protein (mostly albumin) in the urine signal the beginning of a condition called microalbuminuria, often noted in diabetic nephropathy. 30 to 300 mgs of albumin in 2 different 24 hour urine samples is diagnosed as microalbuminuria. More than 300 mgs of albumin is diagnosed as albuminuria. BUN (Blood urea nitrogen), Urea nitrogen is formed when protein are breaks down. The normal value will be in the range of 7 - 20 mg/ dl. Higher than normal level may be an indication for kidney disease. Serum creatinine test measures creatinine level in blood. Creatinine is a breakdown product of creatine, an impoant pa of muscle. This test is done to examine kidney function. If kidney function is abnormal, blood has increased level of creatinine, due to decreased excretion of creatinine in the urine. Creatinine levels will vary depends on the person's size and muscle mass. Glomerular Filtration Rate (GFR), which is the best way to find how well the kidney functions. GFR can be calculated from the blood creatinine, age, race, gender and other factors. GFR value is helpful to determine the stage of kidney disease and helps to plan fuher treatment. Ultrasound or CT scan is helpful to find any physical structural abnormalities, that is the kidney is larger or smaller than normal.

Question 36 asks : Polymenorrhea in a 45 years old woman for 6 months - first line of management. Whereas question 37 asks : Polymenorrhea in a 45 years old woman for 6 months - best line of management. Another thing which I want to point out here is : Question is on \"Polymenorrhea' and not DUB (Which generally refers to anovulatory DUB). As far as first line of management is concerned definately I would investigate the patient to rule out endometrial cancer. In this process I would perform diagnostic D & C . \"In the later reproductive years, even more care must be given to exclude pathological cause because of the possibility of endometrial cancer. Aspiration, curettage or both should clearly establish anovulatory or dyssynchronous cycles as the cause before hormone therapy is staed.\" As far as medical therapy is concerned : In ovulatory cycles - combined oral pills for 3 cycles is given. But staing OCP's in a perimenopausal female without prior investigations is not recommended. Now comes the -tricky\" pa : Best line of management in such cases. As far as D & C is concerned : \"Therapeutic curettage is of no value in the treatment of polymenorrhea.\" So, now we are left with 2 options either medical management with OCP's or hysterectomy. The place of surgery in the treatment of excessive bleeding without an organic basis varies with the age of the patient; it should be a last reso in young girls but may be considered earlier in women above the age of 40 years. Neveheless, in the latter group it is good practice to exclude organic disease by ultrasound and endometrial aspiration, to try medical therapy and proceed to hysterectomy if the response is inadequate or not sustained. When the patient is above 40 years of age, and when the hemorrhage fails to respond to simpler measure, hysterectomy is indicated. It is the treatment of choice in all cases of persistent or recurrent postmenopausal bleeding for which there is no obvious cause. Therefore, hysterectomy is the last reso, first medical management is tried. Hysterectomy personally I feel is not the best treatment as it is a major surgery, has its own complications and high rate of morbidity.

Histopathologically a pa or the full thickness of cervical squamous epithelium is replaced by cells showing varying degree of dysplasia, with intact basement membrane. CIN may be suspected through cytological examination using the Pap smear test or through colposcopic examination. Cervical cytology is the most efficacious and cost-effective method for cancer screening. Final diagnosis of CIN is established by the histopathological examination of a cervical punch biopsy or excision specimen. Additionally, human papilloma virus (HPV) testing can be performed in order to better triage women with early cytologic changes. Cervical Cytology Screening (American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists Guideline) Initial screening Age 21 or 3 y after vaginal sex Interval Every year Every 2-3 y after age 30 with 3 consecutive normals Discontinue No upper limit of age Comparison of Cytology Classification Systems (in simplified form) Bathesda CIN llysplasia Limit of histologic changes *LSIL CIN 1 Mild Basal 1/3rd of sq. epithelium HSIL ON 2 Moderate Basal 1/2 to 2/3rd CIN3 Severe Whole thickness except one or two superficial layers CIS Whole thickness LSIL - Low grade squamous intraepithelial lesion HSIL - High grade squamous intraepithelial lesion CIS - Carcinoma in situ *LSIL incorporates HPV changes (koilocytotic atypia) along with CIN I. Role of HPV HPV infection is found in approx. 90% cases of intraepithelial neoplasia. Type H&18 are most commonly associated. HPV-18 is more specific than HPV-16 for invasive tumors. In most women, the HPV infection clears in 9 to 15 months. Only a minority of women exposed to HPV develop persistent infection that may progress to CIN. Type-16 is the most common HPV type found in women with normal cytology. Treatment CIN 1 Spontaneous regression of CIN 1 is seen in 60% to 85% of cases, typically within 2yrs. So patients who have biopsy diagnoses of C1N 1 are kept under observation with: Pap testing performed at 6 and 12 months Or HPV DNA testing at 12 months After two negative test results or a single negative HPV DNA test, annual screening may be resumed. Women with persistent CIN 1 after 24 months should be treated with a local ablative method. CIN 2 and3 CIN 2&3 carries a much higher probability of progressing to invasive cancer. All CIN 2 and 3 lesions require t reatment. LEEP ( loop electrosurgical excision procedure) is the preferred treatment for CIN 2 and 3. Because all therapeutic modalities carry an inherent recurrence rate of upto 10%. cytologic follow-up at about 3-month intervals for 1 year is necessary. Cryotherapy Considered acceptable therapy when the following criteria are met: - Cervical intraepithelial neoplasia, grade 1 to 2 - Small lesion Ectocervical location only - Negative endocervical sample - No endocervical gland involvement on biopsy Laser Ablation It has been used effectively for the treatment of CIN .But because of the expense of the equipment as well as necessity for special training, laser ablation has fallen out of or. Laser has been widely replaced by LEEP. Laser Excisional Conization Rather than using laser for vaporization leading to ablation, it can be used to excise a conization specimen. The ease of LEEP conization has significantly reduced the indications of laser conization. Loop electrosurgical excision( LEEP) LEEP, variably known as simply loop excision or LLETZ (large loop excision of the transformation zone), is a valuable tool for the diagnosis and treatment of CIN. It uses low-voltage, high-frequency, thin wire loop electrodes to perform a targeted removal of a cervical lesion, an excision of the transformation zone, or a cervical conization. This technique can be used in the outpatient setting Cold knife conization (scalpel) Conization is both a diagnostic and therapeutic procedure and has the advantage over ablative therapies of providing tissue for fuher evaluation to rule out invasive cancer. Conization is indicated for CIN 2&3 in following conditions: - Limits of the lesion cannot be visualized with colposcopy. - The squat-no-columnar junction (SCE) is not seen at colposcopy. - Endocervical curettage (ECC) histologic findings are positive for CIN 2 or CIN 3. - There is a substantial lack of correlation between cytology, biopsy, and colposcopy results. - Microinvasion is suspected based on biopsy, colposcopy, or cytology results. - The colposcopist is unable to rule out invasive cancer.", "cop": 3, "opa": "Cryosurgery", "opb": "Conization", "opc": "LEEP", "opd": "Hysterectomy", "subject_name": "Gynaecology & Obstetrics", "topic_name": null, "id": "c7644e3c-19eb-4cd4-8cee-a8e1cb38a730", "choice_type": "single", "temporal_label": "None"}

{"question": "Best marker to assess prognosis after Surgery for colon carcinoma: March 2005", "exp": "Ans. D: CEA CEA is a family of related glycoproteins initially found in embryonic tissue and colon malignancies. The half-life of CEA is approximately 2 weeks. Plasma levels of CEA can be determined readily by radioimmunoassay. However, its usefulness in colon carcinogenesis screening is limited because of its high level in the plasma of a patient's malignancies originating from other sites such as breast, pancreas, stomach and lung. Fuhermore, CEA plasma levels may also be increased in smokers or patients with chronic diseases, such as inflammatory bowel disease, bronchitis and alcoholic liver disease. The clinical usefulness of CEA for screening purposes is fuher limited by the fact that its increase in level typically occurs only when the tumor penetrates through the serosa. Thus, early lesions may not be detected by serum CEA level changes. CEA is typically elevated with metastatic liver disease, but rarely with peritoneal involvement. Thus, while the specificity for CEA to identify occult CRCs is high, the sensitivity is low in most studies for screening. Accordingly, CEA is not a useful test for the screening of CRC. Regardless of the clinicopathologic stage, a preoperative elevation of the plasma CEA level predicts eventual tumour recurrence.

The most common form in children is postinfectious, following a lower airway tract infection with adenovirus, although influenza, rubeola, Bordetella, and Mycoplasma are also implicated. Persons with bronchiolitis obliterans usually experience dyspnea, coughing, and exercise intolerance. This diagnosis should be considered in children with persistent cough, wheezing, crackles, or hypoxemia persisting longer than 60 days following a lower respiratory tract infection. Chest radiograph abnormalities include evidence of heterogeneous air trapping and airway wall thickening.Ventilation-perfusion scans show a pattern of ventilation and perfusion mismatch. Pulmonary angiograms reveal decreased vasculature in involved lung, and bronchograms show marked pruning of the bronchial tree. Classic findings on chest high-resolution CT include a mosaic perfusion pattern, vascular attenuation, and central bronchiectasis. Suppoive care including supplemental oxygen for hypoxemia, routine vaccination, avoidance of environmental irritant exposure, exercise, and nutritional suppo should be provided. Ongoing airway damage due to problems such as aspiration should be prevented. Inhaled bronchodilators may reverse airway obstruction if the disease has a reactive component. Coicosteroids (inhaled, daily, or pulse dosing) may help reverse the obstruction or prevent ongoing damage.

{"question": "Which of the following is not a live vaccine: September 2011", "exp": "Ans. B: Hepatitis B Hepatitis B vaccine is a killed 'inactivated' vaccine Hepatitis B vaccine The vaccine contains one of the viral envelope proteins, hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg). It is produced by yeast cells, into which the genetic code for HBsAg has been inseed. A course of three (3) vaccine injections are given with the second injection at least one month after the first dose and the third injection given six months after the first dose. The first vaccine became available in 1981. Presently recombinant DNA vaccines are available, which means they are produced by inseing the gene for HBV into common baker's yeast where it is grown, harvested, and purified. It is now believed that the hepatitis B vaccine provides indefinite protection. However, it was previously believed and suggested that the vaccination would only provide effective cover of between five and seven years, but subsequently it has been appreciated that long-term immunity derives from immunological memory which outlasts the loss of antibody levels and hence subsequent testing and administration of booster doses is not required in successfully vaccinated immunocompetent individuals. Hence with the passage of time and longer experience, protection has been shown for at least 25 years in those who showed an adequate initial response to the primary course of vaccinations, and guidelines now suggest that for initial responders who require ongoing protection, such as for healthcare workers, only a single booster is advocated at 5 years.", "cop": 2, "opa": "BCG", "opb": "Hepatitis B", "opc": "Oral polio vaccine", "opd": "MMR", "subject_name": "Social & Preventive Medicine", "topic_name": null, "id": "1af296ef-f393-4dd3-a681-29675abaf3b5", "choice_type": "single", "temporal_label": "None"}

{"question": "A 9 yr old girl has difficulty in combing hairs and climbing upstairs since 6 months. She has Gower's sign positive and maculopapular rash over metacarphalangeal joints. What should be the next appropriate investigation to be done?", "exp": "The mitochondrial creatine kinase (CKm) is present in the mitochondrial intermembrane space, where it regenerates phosphocreatine (PCr) from mitochondrially generated ATP and creatine (Cr) impoed from the cytosol. Apa from the two mitochondrial CK isoenzyme forms, that is, ubiquitous mtCK (present in non-muscle tissues) and sarcomeric mtCK (present in sarcomeric muscle), there are three cytosolic CK isoforms present in the cytosol, depending on the tissue. Whereas MM-CK is expressed in sarcomeric muscle, that is, skeletal and cardiac muscle, MB-CK is expressed in cardiac muscle, and BB-CK is expressed in smooth muscle and in most non-muscle tissues. Mitochondrial mtCK and cytosolic CK are connected in a so-called PCr/Cr-shuttle or circuit. PCr generated by mtCK in mitochondria is shuttled to cytosolic CK that is coupled to ATP-dependent processes, e.g. ATPases, such as acto-myosin ATPase and calcium ATPase involved in muscle contraction, and sodium/potassium ATPase involved in sodium retention in the kidney. The bound cytosolic CK accepts the PCr shuttled through the cell and uses ADP to regenerate ATP, which can then be used as energy source by the ATPases (CK is associated intimately with the ATPases, forming a functionally coupled microcompament). PCr is not only an energy buffer but also a cellular transpo form of energy between subcellular sites of energy (ATP) production (mitochondria and glycolysis) and those of energy utilization (ATPases)Thus, CK enhances skeletal, cardiac, and smooth muscle contractility, and is involved in the generation of blood pressure Finally, high CK in the blood may be an indication of damage to CK-rich tissue, such as in rhabdomyolysis, myocardial infarction, myositis and myocarditis.

What is the diagnosis?", "exp": "Alkaptonuria Age of patient, calcification of interveebral disc, pigmentation and reaction with Benedict's reagent give away the diagnosis of Alkaptonuria. All the options mentioned in this question are inherited disorders of amino acid metabolism. Phenylketonuria, tyrosinemia type 2 and Arigininosuccinic aciduria present during infancy or childhood, whereas Alkaptonuria presents usually at 40 yrs of age. It may go unrecognized until middle life. Mental retardation is usually seen in all the other 3 options. (Mental retardation not seen in Alkaptonuria). Alkaptonuria Triad of: - Homogentisic aciduria - Black pigmentation of cailage and collagenous tissue (ochronosis) - Ochronotic ahritis It is a rare autosomal recessive disorder of tyrosine catabolism. There is deficiency of homogentisic acid oxidase which results in the accumulation of homogentisic acid pigment cailages and collagenous tissues (ochronosis). Large amount of homogentisic acid is excreted in urine which gets oxidised on exposure to air and impas urine a dark colour especially if the pH of urine is alkaline. Alkaptonuria is usually recognised by 30-40 yrs of age when degenerative joint disease and ochronosis (pigmentation) become noticeable. Ochronosis ahritis commonly involves shoulder, hips and knees. The interveebral discs are degenerated, spaces are narrowed and calcification occurs. Ochronosis or pigmentation can involve- hea valves, larynx, tympanic membrane, sclera, ear cailage and skin. Occasionally pigmented renal or prostatic calculi can occur. Homogentisic acid (HGA) is a strong reducing agent and gives positive reaction with Benedict's & Fehling's reagent. A greenish brown precipitate with brownish black supernatant develops with Benedict's reagent and transient blue green colour develops with Fehling's (FeC13) reagent. The diagnosis is confirmed by measurement of HGA concentration in urine by paper and thin layer chromatography. Low protein diet especially low in phenylalanine and tyrosine is advocated in combination with ascorbic acid, but not very effective. Addition of nitisinone (an inhibitor of the enzyme 4-hydroxyphenylpyruvate dioxygenase which catalyzes the formation of homogentisic acid) drastically reduces urinary excretion of homogentisic acid might prevent the long term complication of alkaptonuria.", "cop": 2, "opa": "Phenylketonuria", "opb": "Alkaptonuria", "opc": "Tyrosinemia type-2", "opd": "Argininosuccinic aciduria", "subject_name": "Biochemistry", "topic_name": null, "id": "5d702105-b828-46c1-9163-6a85c5ba5b01", "choice_type": "single", "temporal_label": "Progressive"}

Post Kala Azar dermal leishmaniasisLeishmaniasis is a disease caused by an intracellular protozoan parasite (genus Leishmania) transmitted by the bite of a sandfly.Classification: Categorization by clinical disease: In this system, leishmaniasis is divided into 3 primary clinical forms:1. Cutaneous (localized, diffuse (disseminated), leishmaniasis recidivans, post-kala-azar dermal leishmaniasis),2. Mucocutaneous,3. Visceral (kala-azar).Cutaneous leishmaniasis includes the following features:a. Localized cutaneous leishmaniasis; Crusted papules or ulcers on exposed skin; lesions may be associated with sporotrichotic spreadb Diffuse (disseminated) cutaneous leishmaniasis: Multiple, widespread nontender, nonulcerating cutaneous papules and nodules; analogous to lepromatous leprosy lesionsc. Leishmaniasis recidivans: Presents as a recurrence of lesions at the site of apparently healed disease years after the original infection, typically on the face and often involving the cheek; manifests as an enlarging papule, plaque, or coalescence of papules that heals with central scarring (i.e, lesions in the center or periphery of an old healed leishmaniasis scar); relentless expansion at the periphery may cause significant facial destruction similar to the lupus vulgaris variant of cutaneous tuberculosisd. Post-kala-azar dermal leishmaniasis; Develops months to years after the patient's recovery from visceral leishmaniasis, with cutaneous lesions ranging from hypopigmented macules to erythematous papules and from nodules to plaques; the lesions may be numerous and persist for decades. Mucocutaneous leishmaniasis consists of the relentless destruction of the oropharynx and nose, resulting in extensive MID facial destruction.Visceral and viscerotropic leishmaniasis include the following features:a Visceral leishmaniasis (kala-azar): Potentially lethal widespread systemic disease characterized by darkening of the skin as well as the pentad of fever, weight loss, hepatosplenomegaly, pancytopenia, and hypergammaglobulinemiab. Viscerotropic leishmaniasis: Nonspecific abdominal tenderness; fever, rigors, fatigue, malaise, nonproductive cough, intermittent diarrhea, headache, arthralgias, myalgias, nausea, adenopathy.Management- Pharmacologic therapies include the following:a.

Class II: unicornuate uterus (a one-sided uterus). - Only one side of the Mullerian duct forms. - The uterus has a typical \"penis shape\" on imaging systems. Class III: Uterus didelphys (double uterus). - Both Mullerian ducts develop but fail to fuse, thus the patient has a \"double uterus\". - This may be a condition with a double cervix and a vaginal paition (v.i.), or the lower Mullerian system fused into its unpaired condition.

B: Pressure Abrasion Teeth marks in biting and ligature marks in hanging and strangulation are example of imprint, pressure or contact abrasion Abrasion It as also known as - Graze or Scratch or Impression. An abrasion is a superficial injury to the skin which involves the loss of superficial epithelial layer (Uppermost layers of the cells of skin) of skin. Abrasions are produced by ? - Blow - Fall on some rough and hard substance - Dragging as in vehicular accidents. - Scratching with finger nails, bites and thorns etc. - Friction on some hard substance. Pressure of rope or cord as is found in strangulation and hanging etc. - Rubbing. - Indenting of the objects. Varieties of Abrasions Scratches- They are due to a sharp or a pointed object pressing across the skin, moving the surface layers in front of it and causing the heaping up of layers of skin. Grazes- They are modified scratches. - In this, the broader surface of skin comes in contact with the uneven rough object. - In this, the depth may vary at different places. - The direction is indicated by presence of clean commencement and tag at the finishing end. Impact Abrasions/Pressure Abrasions - They are also known as \"Imprint abrasions\". - They are caused by the stamping of some object against the skin like radiators of cars in vehicular accidents or - They may be caused by pressure on the skin which is accompanied by movements as found in?

{"question": "Zonal hepatic necrosis is associated with: March 2010", "exp": "Ans. B: Acetaminophen Patterns of liver injuries A. Zonal Necrosis This is the most common type of drug induced liver cell necrosis where the injury is largely confined to a paicular zone of the liver lobule. It may manifest as very high level of ALT and severe disturbance of liver function leading to acute liver failure. Causes include: Carbon tetrachloride Paracetamol Acetaminophen (paracetamol) is usually well tolerated in prescribed dose but overdose is the most common cause of drug induced liver disease and acute liver failure worldwide. Damage to the liver is not due to the drug itself but to a toxic metabolite (N-acetyl- p-benzoquinone imine NAPQI, or NABQI) which is produced by cytochrome P450 enzymes in the liver. In normal circumstances this metabolite is detoxified by conjugating with glutathione in phase 2 reaction. In overdose large amount of NAPQI is generated which overwhelm the detoxification process and lead to damage to liver cells. Administration of Acetylcysteine, a precursor of glutathione, can limit the severity of the liver damage by capturing the toxic NAPQI. B. Hepatitis In this pattern hepatocellular necrosis is associated with infiltration of inflammatory cells. There can be three types of drug induced hepatitis. Viral hepatitis type picture is the commonest, where histological features are similar to acute viral hepatitis. Causes include: Halothane, isoniazid, phenytoin In the focal or non specific hepatitis scattered foci of cell necrosis may accompany lymphocytic infiltrate. Causes include: Aspirin Chronic hepatitis type is very similar to autoimmune hepatitis clinically, serologically as well as histologically. Causes include: Methyldopa, diclofenac C. Cholestasis Liver injury leads to impairment of bile flow and clinical picture is predominated by itching and jaundice. Histology may show inflammation (cholestatic hepatitis) or it can be bland without any parenchymal inflammation. In rare occasions it can produce features similar to primary biliary cirrhosis due to progressive destruction of small bile ducts (Vanishing duct syndrome). Causes include: Bland: Oral contraceptive pills, anabolic steroid, androgens Inflammatory: Allopurinol, co-amoxiclav, carbamazepine Ductal: Chlorpromazine, flucloxacillin D. Steatosis Hepatotoxicity may manifest as triglyceride accumulation which leads to either small droplet (microvesicular) or large droplet (macrovesicular) fatty liver. There is a separate type of steatosis where phospholipid accumulation leads to a pattern similar to the diseases with inherited phospholipid metabolism defects (e.g. Tay-Sachs disease). Causes include: Microvesicular: Aspirin (Reye's syndrome), ketoprofen, tetracycline Macrovesicular: Acetamenophen, methotrexate Phospholipidosis: Amiodarone, total parenteral nutrition E. Granuloma Drug induced hepatic granulomas are usually associated with granulomas in other tissues and patients typically have features of systemic vasculitis and hypersensitivity. Causes include: Allopurinol, phenytoin, isoniazid, quinine, penicillin, quinidine F. Vascular lesions They result from injury to the vascular endothelium. Peliosis hepatis: anabolic steroid Hepatic vein thrombosis: Oral contraceptives G. Neoplasm Neoplasms have been described with prolonged exposure to some medications or toxins.

{"question": "All of the following are seen in rickets except: September 2009", "exp": "Ans. A: Frenkels Line In rickets, the skeletal effects are due to lack of calcification of osteoid. The first changes of rickets appear in rapidly growing distal ends of ulna & radius (wrist & knee are commonly involved due to more use). Rarefaction of provisional zone of calcification with widening of epiphysis- diaphysis distance is first to appear. The most obvious change are at 'metaphysis'- where rapid growth is occurring. First change to appear is a 'loss of normal zone of provisional calcification' adjacent to metaphysis. This begins as an indistinctness of the metaphyseal margin, progressing to a 'frayed' appearance with widening of the growth plate, due to lack of calcification of metaphyseal bone. Weight bearing & stress on uncalcified bone gives rise to 'splaying' Sr 'cupping' of metaphysis. A similar but less marked effect occurs in subperiosteal layer, which may cause lack of distinctness of coical margin. Eventually a generalized reduction in bone density is seen. In the epiphysis - there may be some haziness of coical margin. Thus all findings in Rickets occur due to failure of calcification & abnormal demineralization i.

{"question": "All of the following are true for retinoblastoma except: March 2011", "exp": "Ans. B: Always unilateral The fellow eye in retinoblastoma, is affected, independently, not by metastasis, in about one-fouh of the cases Retinoblastoma/ Rb It is a rapidly developing cancer that develops in the cells of retina In the developed world, Rb has one of the best cure rates of all childhood cancers (95-98%), with more than nine out of every ten sufferers surviving into adulthood Classification There are two forms of the disease; a heritable form and non-heritable form (all cancers are considered genetic in that mutations of the genome are required for their development, but this does not imply that they are heritable, or transmitted to offspring). Approximately 55% of children with Rb have the non-heritable form. If there is no history of the disease within the family, the disease is labeled \"sporadic\", but this does not necessarily indicate that it is the non-heritable form. In about two thirds of cases, only one eye is affected (unilateral retinoblastoma); in the other third, tumours develop in both eyes (bilateral retinoblastoma). The number and size of tumours on each eye may vary. In ceain cases, the pineal gland is also affected (trilateral retinoblastoma). Signs and symptoms The most common and obvious sign of retinoblastoma is an abnormal appearance of the pupil, leukocoria, also known as amaurotic cat's eye reflex. Some children with retinoblastoma can develop a squint, commonly referred to as \"cross-eyed\" or \"wall-eyed\" (strabismus). Retinoblastoma presents with advanced disease in developing countries and eye enlargement is a common finding. A white eye reflection is not always a positive indication of retinoblastoma and can be caused by light being reflected badly or by other conditions such as Coats's Disease. Frequency of retinoblastoma Most children are diagnosed before the age of five years old.In developed countries, bilateral cases usually present within the first year with the average age at diagnosis being 9 months. Diagnosis of unilateral cases peaks between 24 and 30 months. Cause of retinoblastoma In children with the heritable genetic form of retinoblastoma there is a mutation on chromosome 13, called the RB1 gene. The defective RB1 gene can be inherited from either parent; in some children, however, the mutation occurs in the early stages of fetal development. Inherited forms of retinoblastomas are more likely to be bilateral; in addition, they may be associated with pinealoblastoma (also known as trilateral retinoblastoma) with a dismal outcome. Differential diagnosis Persistent hyperplastic primary vitreous (PHPV): congenital developmental anomaly of the eye resulting from failure of the embryological, primary vitreous and hyaloid vasculature to regress, whereby the eye is shoer, develops a cataract, and may present with whitening of the pupil. Coat's disease: a typically unilateral disease characterised by abnormal development of blood vessels behind the retina, leading to blood vessel abnormalities in the retina and retinal detachment to mimic retinoblastoma. Toxocara canis: an infectious disease of the eye associated with exposure to infected puppies, which causes a retinal lesion leading to retinal detachment. Retinopathy of prematurity (ROP): associated with low bih weight infants who receive supplemental oxygen in the period immediately after bih, it involves damage to the retinal tissue and may lead to retinal detachment. Morphology Gross and microscopic appearances of retinoblastoma are identical in both hereditary and sporadic types. Macroscopically, ble tumor cells are found near blood vessels, while zones of necrosis are found in relatively avascular areas. Microscopically, both undifferentiated and differentiated elements may be present. Undifferentiated elements appear as collections of small, round cells with hyperchromatic nuclei; differentiated elements include Flexner-Wintersteiner rosettes, Homer-Wright rosettes, and fluerettes from photoreceptor differentiation Treatment The first priority is to preserve the life of the child, then to preserve the vision and thirdly to minimize any complications or side effects of the treatment.

{"question": "Impotency may be seen in: September 2007", "exp": "Ans. D: All of the abovePhysiological aspect:The hypothalamus releases GnRH in a pulsatile nature which appears to be essential for stimulating the production and release of both luteinizing hormone (LH) and follicle stimulating hormone (FSH).LH and FSH are produced in the anterior pituitary and are secreted episodically in response to the pulsatile release of GnRH.LH and FSH both bind to specific receptors on the Leydig cells and Seoli cells within the testis. Testosterone, the major secretory product of the testes, is a primary inhibitor of LH secretion in males.Testosterone may be metabolized in peripheral tissue to the potent androgen dihydrotestosterone or the potent estrogen estradiol.These androgens and estrogens act independently to modulate LH secretion.The mechanism of feedback control of FSH is regulated by a Seoli cell product called inhibin.Decreases in spermatogenesis are accompanied by decreased production of inhibin and this reduction in negative feedback is associated with reciprocal elevation of FSH levels.Prolactin also has a complex inter-relationship with the gonadotropins, LH and FSH.In males with hyperprolactinemia, the prolactin tends to inhibit the production of GnRH.In individuals with elevated prolactin levels who are given testosterone, libido and sexual function do not return to normal as long as the prolactin levels are elevated.Hromonal causes of impotency:Hormone disorders account for fewer than 5% of cases of impotence.Testosterone deficiency, which occurs rarely, can result in a loss of libido (sexual desire) and loss of erection.Among other conditions, an excess of the hormone prolactin, caused by pituitary gland tumor, reduces levels of testosterone.Hormone imbalances can also result from kidney or liver disease.Other causes:Mumps is known to cause testicular failure.A varicocele can reduce hormonal production as well.", "cop": 4, "opa": "Mumps orchitis", "opb": "Testosetrone deficiency", "opc": "Prolactinoma", "opd": "All of the above", "subject_name": "Physiology", "topic_name": null, "id": "6c66cd6d-b7ad-4f25-8a71-6f7de0a1695f", "choice_type": "multi", "temporal_label": "None"}

D: Apex of the upper lobeSecondary pulmonary tuberculosis classically involves the apex of the upper lobes of one or both the lungsSecondary tuberculosisIt is usually due to the reactivation of old lesions or gradual progression of primary tuberculosis into chronic form.The characteristics of secondary tuberculosis include extensive tissue damages due to immunologic reactions of the host to tubercle bacilli and their products.Primary vs Secondary TuberculosisWhen a host has first contact with tubercle bacilli:- An acute exudative lesion develops and rapidly spreads to the lymphatics and regional lymph nodes.- The exudative lesion in tissue often heals rapidly.- The lymph node undergoes caseation, which usually calcifies.- The tuberculin test becomes positive.If the primary lesion could not contained rapidly, the appearance of hypersensitivity to tuberculin provokes a dramatic change in the host's response to the organisms.The nonspecific inflammatory response evoked on first exposure to tubercle bacilli becomes granulomatous, evoking the formation of tubercles.The tubercle comprises an organized aggregation of enlarged macrophages that, because they resemble epithelial cells, are referred to as epithelioid cells.A peripheral collar of fibroblasts, macrophages, and lymphocytes surrounds the granuloma.Frequently the central region of epithelioid cells undergoes a characteristic caseous necrosis to produce a \"soft\" tubercle, the most characteristic hallmark of tuberculosis.When the antigen load at the initial infection site and regional lymph node is large, caseation necrosis may develop and lesions may later calcify.These calcified lesions of the primary site are referred to as the Ghon complex.After the development of hypersensitivity, the infection becomes quiescent and asymptomatic in the majority of patients (about 90%).In some, however, especially the very young and adults who are immunocompromised or who have other predisposing illnesses, the primary infection may evolve into clinical disease.The progression may be local at the site of the primary lesion, or it may be at one or more distant sites where bacilli have arrived during the early hematogenous spread.In a small number of persons whose initial tuberculous infection subsidies, secondary disease occurs in spite of acquired cellular immunity.In this phase of the disease, lesions are usually localized in the apices of the lungs (remember that tubercle bacilli require oxygen for growth).In about 5% of patients, apical pulmonary tuberculosis manifests itself within 2 years of the primary infection.Because of the acquired cellular immunity, bacilli are more promptly phagocytized and destroyed by the activated macrophages.As a result, in secondary tuberculosis, lesions remain localized and dissemination of organisms the lymphatic vessels is usually prevented.Hypersensitivity promotes a more rapid caseation and fibrotic walling-off of the focus.Histologically the reaction is characteristic of tubercle formation, manifested by a local accumulation of lymphocytes and macrophages.T lymphocytes and their chemotactic lymphokines play a major role in the development of tuberculous granuloma.These differences between primary infection and post-primary or reactivation are attributed to (1) resistance and (2) hypersensitivity induced by the first infection of the host with tubercle bacilli.", "cop": 4, "opa": "Lower pa of upper lobe", "opb": "Upper pa of lower lobe", "opc": "Lower pa of lower lobe", "opd": "Apex of the upper lobe", "subject_name": "Pathology", "topic_name": null, "id": "3aef0dd6-2726-44e9-a0a9-c7fd7ccdd825", "choice_type": "single", "temporal_label": "None"}

Pityriasis rosea is a benign condition that usually presents with a herald patch, a single round or oval lesion appearing anywhere on the body. Usually about 5 to 10 days after the appearance of the herald patch, a more diffuse rash involving the upper extremities and trunk appears. These lesions are oval or round, slightly raised, and pink to brown in color. The lesion is covered in a fine scale with some central clearing possible. The rash can appear in a Christmas tree pattern on the back, identified by the aligning of the long axis of the lesions with the cutaneous cleavage lines. The rash lasts 2 to 12 weeks and can be pruritic. This rash is commonly mistaken for tinea corporis, and the consideration of secondary syphilis is important.Treatment is usually unnecessary but can consist of topical emollients and oral antihistamines, as needed. More uncommonly, topical steroids can be helpful if the itching is severe. Lichen planus is rare in children. It is intensely pruritic, and additional lesions can be induced with scratching. The lesion is commonly found on the flexor surfaces of the wrists, forearms, inner thighs, and occasionally on the oral mucosa. Seborrheic dermatitis can begin anytime during life; it frequently presents as cradle cap in the newborn period. This rash is commonly greasy, scaly, and erythematous and, in smaller children, involves the face, neck, axilla, and diaper area. In older children, the rash can be localized to the scalp and intertriginous areas. Pruritus can be marked. Contact dermatitis is characterized by redness, weeping, and oozing of the affected skin. The pattern of distribution can be helpful in identification of the offending agent. The rash can be pruritic; removal of the causative agent and use of topical emollients or steroids is curative. Psoriasis consists of red papules that coalesce to form plaques with sharp edges. A thick, silvery scale develops on the surface and leaves a drop of blood upon its removal (Auspitz sign).

C: FT-ABS T. pallidum cannot be grown in vitro Diagnostic tests for syphilis: Tests include serologic tests for syphilis (STS), which consist of screening (reaginic) and confirmatory (treponemal) tests, and dark field microscopy. Reaginic tests use lipid antigens (cardiolipin from bovine heas) to detect reagin (human antibodies that bind to lipids). The Venereal Disease Research Laboratory (VDRL) and rapid plasma reagin (RPR) tests are sensitive, simple, and inexpensive reaginic tests that are used for screening but are not specific for syphilis. Results may be presented qualitatively (e.g., reactive, weakly reactive, borderline, or nonreactive) and quantitatively as titers (e.g., positive at 1:16 dilution). Many disorders other than treponemal infections (e.g., SLE, antiphospholipid antibody syndromes) can produce a positive (biologically false-positive) reagin test result. CSF reaginic tests are reasonably sensitive for early disease but less so for late neurosyphilis. CSF reagin tests can be used to diagnose neurosyphilis or to monitor response to treatment by measuring antibody titers. Treponemal tests detect antitreponemal antibodies qualitatively and are very specific for syphilis.

This remarkable diurnal variation in secretion is brought about by norepinephrine secreted by the postganglionic sympathetic nerves (nervi conarii) that innervate the pineal.

{"question": "Causes of floaters in DM is: (PGI May 2010)", "exp": "Ans: A (Vitreous hemorrahage) \"Sometimes the onset of new floaters is secondary to Vitreous hemorrahage, often caused by advanced Diabetic retinopathy\"- Parson 20th/88Vitreous detachment also cause floaters (But as Q is specifically asked about cause in MD, so should not be marked as answer)Floaters20th/88-89& www.diife.com/diabetes/information//.../chous_ march06It occur when the vitreous, a gel-like substance that fills about 80 percent of the internal eye, slowly shrinks. As the vitreous shrinks, it becomes somewhat stringy, and the strands can cast tiny shadows on the retina.In most cases, floaters are part of the natural aging process and simply an annoyance. Over time, they tend to settle to the bottom of the eye, becoming less bothersomeFloaters are more likely to develop as we age and are more common in people who are very nearsighted, have diabetes, or who have had previous eye surgeryQ.There are other, more serious causes of floaters, including infection, inflammation (uveitis), hemorrhaging, retinal tears, and injury to the eye.People with diabetes tend to have more floaters because high blood glucose alters the chemical composition of the vitreous, causing it to shrink more rapidly. Also, people with diabetes are more likely to have bleeding inside the eyes as a result of diabetic retinopathy, and patients will sometimes visualize individual red blood cells floating around within their vitreous (sort of looks like hundreds of discrete, little peppercorns.)Patients with severe diabetic retinopathy (proliferative diabetic retinopathy) are especially at risk for a retinal detachment, as abnormal blood %ressels growing into the vitreous are more firmly attached to the retina, pulling it away as the vitreous shrinks (like wall paper being pulled off a wall). If left untreated, a retinal detachment can lead to permanent visual impairment or blindness within a few' days or even hours.Sometimes, a section of the vitreous pulls away (detaches) from the retina all at once, rather than gradually, causing many new floaters to appear suddenly. This is called a vitreous detachment, w'hich in most cases is not sight- threatening and requires only close observation, not treatment.However, a sudden increase in floaters, possibly accompanied by light flashes or peripheral (side) vision loss, could indicate a retinal detachmentFig.: illustration of a floater within the vireousposterior vitreous detachment (PVD) is a condition of the eye in which the vitreous humour separates from the retina", "cop": 1, "opa": "Vitreous hemorrahage", "opb": "Vitreal detachment", "opc": "Maculopathy", "opd": "Infarction", "subject_name": "Ophthalmology", "topic_name": "Vascular Disorders", "id": "977622e2-d33e-4fdf-91d4-f01e96fc6048", "choice_type": "single", "temporal_label": "None"}
{"question": "A 28 yrs old lady, is suspected to have polycystic ovarian disease ,sample for testing LH and FSH are best taken on the following days of menstrual cycle", "exp": "In PCOD Determination of FSH and LH may help to confirm the diagnosis of poly cystic ovaries . These are assayed on the second or third day of cycle Lutenizing Hormone (LH) and Follicle Stimulating Hormone (FSH) LH and FSH are the hormones that encourage ovulation. Both LH and FSH are secreted by the pituitary gland in the brain. At the beginning of the cycle, LH and FSH levels usually range between about 5-20 mlU/ml. Most women have about equal amounts of LH and FSH during the early pa of their cycle. However, there is a LH surge in which the amount of LH increases to about 25-40 mlU/ml 24 hours before ovulation occurs. Once the egg is released by the ovary, the LH levels goes back down. While many women with PCOS still have LH and FSH still within the 5-20 mlU/ml range, their LH level is often two or three times that of the FSH level. For example, it is typical for women with PCOS to have an LH level of about 18 mlU/ml and a FSH level of about 6 mlU/ml (notice that both levels fall within the normal range of 5-20 mlU/ml). This situation is called an elevated LH to FSH ratio or a ratio of 3:1. This change in the LH to FSH ratio is enough to disrupt ovulation. While this used to be considered an impoant aspect in diagnosing PCOS, it is now considered less useful in diagnosing PCOS, but is still helpful when looking at the overall picture.

Harrison 17th/p. 1477)Harrison 12th/p. 1477The extent and velocity of wall motion are normal or even supernormal, until myocardial contractility declines. A rapid, high-frequency fluttering of the anterior mitral leaflet produced by the impact of the regurgitant jet is a characteristic finding. The echocardiogram is also useful in determining the cause of AR, by detecting dilatation of the aortic annulus and root or aortic dissection.AORTIC REGURGITATIONEtiology# In approximately two-thirds of patients with valvular AR, the disease is rheumatic in origin.# AR represents the most frequent serious lesion in patients surviving nonpenetrating cardiac injuries.Pathophysiology# In patients with wide-open (free) AR, the volume of regurgitant flow may equal the effective forward stroke volume.# In contrast to MR, in which a fraction of the LV stroke volume is delivered into the low-pressure LA, in AR the entire LV stroke volume is ejected into a high-pressure zone, the aorta.# Considerable thickening of the LV wall also occurs with chronic AR and Myocardial ischemia may occur.C/f# M>F# In patients with acute severe AR, as may occur in infective endocarditis, aortic dissection, or trauma, pulmonary edema and/or cardiogenic shock may develop rapidly.# Chronic severe AR may develop.Physical Findings# UNCOMMON SIGNS OF AORTIC REGURGITATION INCLUDE;- Large-volume, 'collapsing' pulse also known as:1. Watson's water hammer pulse Q2. Corrigan's pulse (rapid upstroke and collapse of the carotid artery pulse). Corrigan's pulse: A rapidly rising \"water-hammer\" pulse, which collapses suddenly as arterial pressure falls rapidly during late systole and diastole.3. Quincke's pulse: Capillary pulsations, an alternate flushing and paling of the skin at the root of the nail while pressure is applied to the tip of the nail.4. Traube's sign: A booming \"pistol-shot\" sound heard over the femoral arteries.5. Duroziez's sign: a to-and-fro murmur audible if the femoral artery is lightly compressed with a stethoscope.6. de Musset's sign: jarring of the entire body and the bobbing motion of the head with each systole.7. Hill's sign: a > 20 mm Hg diff in popliteal and brachial systolic cuff pressures, seen in chronic severe AI.8. Lighthouse sign (blanching & flushing of forehead)9.

Sherman sign (dorsalis pedis pulse is quickly located & unexpectedly prominent in age>75 yr)17. Ashrafian sign (Pulsatile pseudo-proptosis).In many patients with pure AR or with combined AS and AR, the carotid arterial pulse is bisferiens, i.e., with two systolic waves separated by a troughsAuscultation# In patients with severe AR, the aortic valve closure sound (A2) is usually absent.# An S3 and systolic ejection sound are frequently audible, and occasionally an S4 also may be heard.# The murmur of chronic AR is typically a high-pitched, blowing, decrescendo diastolic murmur, heard best in the third intercostal space along the left sternal border.# \"Cooing\" or musical diastolic murmurs suggest eversion of an aortic cusp vibrating in the regurgitant stream.# A mid-systolic ejection murmur is frequently audible in isolated AR. It is generally heard best at the base of the heart and is transmitted along the carotid vessels.# A third murmur frequently heard in patients with severe AR is the Austin Flint murmur, a soft, low-pitched, rumbling mid-diastolic murmur. It is probably produced by the diastolic displacement of the anterior leaflet of the mitral valve by the AR stream but does not appear to be associated with hemodynamically significant mitral obstruction.# The auscultatory features of AR are intensified by strenuous handgrip, which augments systemic resistance.ECG# In patients with chronic severe AR, the ECG signs of LV hypertrophy become manifest.# In addition, these patients frequently exhibit ST-segment depression and T-wave inversion in leads I, aVL, V5, and V6 (\"LV strain\").# Left axis deviation and/or QRS prolongation denote diffuse myocardial disease, generally associated with patchy fibrosis, and usually signify a poor prognosis.Echocardiogram# The extent and velocity of wall motion are normal or even supernormal, until myocardial contractility declines.# A rapid, high-frequency fluttering of the anterior mitral leaflet produced by the impact of the regurgitant jet is a characteristic finding.0# Color flow Doppler echocardiographic imaging is very sensitive in the detection of AR, and Doppler echocardiography is helpful in assessing its severity.# With severe AR, the central jet width exceeds 65% of the left ventricular outflow tract, the regurgitant volume is 60 ml/ beat, the regurgitant fraction is 50%, and there is diastolic flow reversal in the proximal descending thoracic aorta.Chest X-RayIn chronic severe AR, the apex is displaced downward and to the left in the frontal projection. In the left anterior oblique and lateral projections, the LV is displaced posteriorly and encroaches on the spine.Aortic Regurgitation: TreatmentAcute Aortic RegurgitationPatients with acute severe AR may respond to intravenous diuretics and vasodilators (such as sodium nitroprusside), but stabilization is usually short-lived and operation is indicated urgently. Intra aortic balloon counterpulsation is contraindicated. Beta-blockers are also best avoided. Surgery is the treatment of choice.Chronic Aortic RegurgitationEarly symptoms of dyspnea and effort intolerance respond to treatment with diuretics, and vasodilators (ACE inhibitors, dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers, or hydralazine) may be useful as well. Surgery can then be performed in more controlled circumstances. Expert consensus is strong regarding the need to control systolic blood pressure (goal <140 mmHg) in patients with chronic AR, and vasodilators are an excellent first choice as antihypertensive agents. Beta blockers may be useful to retard the rate of aortic root enlargement in young patients with Marfan syndrome and aortic root dilatation with no or only mild AR.

Absolute contraindications - Nitrous oxide is contraindicated in patients with significant respiratory compromise. The blood: gas paition coefficient of nitrous oxide is 34 times greater than that of nitrogen. This differential solubility means that nitrous oxide can leave the bloodstream and enter air-filled cavities 34 times faster than nitrogen. As a result, nitrous is contraindicated in patients in whom expansion of these air-filled cavities could compromise patient safety. This includes patients with pneumothorax, pulmonary blebs, air embolism, bowel obstruction, and those undergoing surgery of the middle ear and tympanoplasties. - Pneumoperitoneum - Pneumoencephalum - Acute intestinal surgeries and volvulus of gut as it may increase gut distension Relative contraindications - Nitrous oxide is known to interfere with vitamin B12 and folate metabolism. In patients with these preexisting conditions, nitrous oxide should only be used with full precautionary consideration and close monitoring. Paicular precautions should be taken in pediatric patients with underlying vitamin B12 deficiency (genetic or environmental) and conditions related to vitamin B12 deficiency. Nitrous oxide is relatively contraindicated in pregnancy. It is known to have potential teratogenic and fetal toxic effects, paicularly with chronic use.

{"question": "True regarding rubella infection in pregnancy is: March 2010", "exp": "Ans. C: IgM antibodies in fetus reflects immunity Fetal rubella syndrome is a congenital disorder resulting from primary maternal infection with the rubella virus. It is characterized mainly by deafness, mental retardation, congenital cataract, hea defects, and other structural anomalies that may be found with variable severity and frequency. During acute rubella in pregnancy, the rate of congenital infection is over 90% in the 12 first weeks of pregnancy, approximately 60% in weeks 13 to 17, 25% in weeks 18 to 24 and then increases again during the last month of pregnancy. Etiology: It is caused by a RNA togavirus, which is the only member of the genus Rubivirus. The fetus is infected by transplacental transmission. Administration of rubella vaccine has significantly reduced the incidence of maternal infection, although reinfection after vaccination is possible. The development of fetal infection reaches 50% among those exposed during the first trimester and 20% during the second trimester. Diagnosis: The most frequent sonographic findings are cardiac malformations (in paicular, septal defects), eye defects (cataracts, microphthalmia, and retinopathy), microcephaly, hepatomegaly, splenomegaly and growth restriction. Deafness and mental retardation are expected after bih. Test for rubella specific antibody (IgM) should be done within 10 days of the exposure to know whether patient is immune or not. Associated anomalies: Occasionally the following anomalies can be associated with the classic findings of fetal rubella syndrome: renal disorders, hypospadias, cryptorchidism, meningocele, glaucoma, patent ductus aeriosus, and peripheral pulmonary stenosis. Differential diagnosis: All the conditions that can be associated with congenital hepatomegaly and/or cataract should be excluded. It includes congenital infections (TORCHS), fetal anemia, fetal liver tumor, chondrodysplasia punctata, NeuLaxova syndrome, Smith-Lemli-Opitz syndrome, and Walker-Warburg syndrome. Prognosis: Intrauterine death may occur. Postnatal impact of the intrauterine infection varies from absence of any defect to all the anomalies mentioned above with variable severity. The agent may remain for years in the tissues, causing chronic infection and its complications (such as diabetes mellitus due to chronic viropathy of the pancreas). Management: Termination of pregnancy should be considered every time fetal infection is detected during the first trimester, due to the severity of the condition in this group. After bility, monthly sonographic monitoring for growth and follow-up of the anomalies is recommended. Prevention: Women found to be susceptible during pregnancy should be offered vaccination postpaum and before discharge from the hospital (vaccine is not recommended in pregnancy).

However, it may reduce sympathetically mediated arteriolar and venous constriction, and the resulting venous pooling may reduce cardiac output and arterial pressure These hemodynamic disturbances usually respond promptly to elevation of the legs, but in some patients, volume expansion with intravenous saline is required. The patient may experience diaphoresis and nausea, but these events usually pass and are replaced by a feeling of well-being associated with the relief of pain. Morphine also has a vagotonic effect and may cause bradycardia or advanced degrees of heart block, particularly in patients with inferior infarction. These side effects usually respond to atropine (0.5 mg intravenously). Morphine is routinely administered by repetitive (every 5 min) intravenous injection of small doses (2--4 mg), rather than by the subcutaneous administration of a larger quantity; because absorption may be unpredictable by the latter route.-- Harrison 19/e p1603.Management of Patients with ST-segment Elevation Myocardial InfarctionPrehospital, emergency medical service providers should administer aspirin (162 to 325 mg) to all patients not already taking aspirin, obtain a 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) in patients suspected of having STEMIQ, review a reperfusion checklist, and relay this information to a medical facility.Patients with STEMI who have cardiogenic shock, those with contraindications to lytics. and those at high-risk of dying because of heart failure should be channeled immediately to a facility capable of cardiac catheterizationQ.Initial Recognition and Evaluation in the Emergency DepartmentInitial evaluation in the emergency department focuses on identification of STEMI, early therapy, and reperfusion strategySelection of reperfusion strategy' depends on hospital and patient characteristics.Time to reperfusion therapy strongly influences outcomes in STEMI.Patients presenting to a hospital with percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) capability should undergo PCI within 90 minutes of first medical contact as a systems goalQ.Patients with STEMI presenting to a non-PCI-capable hospital should be considered for transfer to a PCI-capable hospital based on patient characteristics time from symptom onset, and time to available PCI therapySTEMI patients presenting to a hospital without PCI capability and who cannot be transferred to a PCI center and undergo PCI within 90 minutes of first medical contact should receive fibrinolytic therapy within 30 minutes of hospital presentation as a systems goat in the absence of contraindications.If pharmacologic reperfusion is selected, fibrinolytic therapy should be administered to STEMI patients with symptom onset within the prior 12 hoursQ.In the absence of contraindications, it is reasonable to administer fibrinolytic therapy to patients with symptoms of STEMI beginning within the prior 12 to 24 hours who have continuing ischemic symptoms & electrocardiographic evidence of STEMIQ.Fibrinolytic therapy should not be administered to asymptomatic patients whose initial symptoms of STEMI began more than 24 hours earlier nor to patients whose 12-lead ECG show s only ST- segment depression, except if a true posterior myocardial infarction (MI) is suspectedQ.Patients should be evaluated for contraindications to fibrinolytic therapy such as a history of intracranial hemorrhage (ICH), significant closed head or facial trauma within the past 3 months, uncontrolled hypertension, or ischemic stroke within the past 3 months.STEMI patients at substantial (4%) risk of ICH should be treated with PCI rather than with fibrinolytic therapyQ.", "cop": 1, "opa": "Thrombolysis", "opb": "Aspirin", "opc": "Statin", "opd": "Morphine", "subject_name": "Medicine", "topic_name": "C.V.S.", "id": "b6a4aed6-bda6-4ab0-bc6e-2fbc4623a2fd", "choice_type": "single", "temporal_label": "None"}

It may also be seen in ascariasis, malaria, tumour and tuberculosis. Once the lymph channels are blocked, one may open into the kidney hilum or ureter or sometimes into the bladder and chyle can leak into the urinary tract resulting in milky white urine.It may also result in renal colic and hypoproteinemia.

A: Males more often affected Congenital Hypothyroidism (CH) is one of the most common preventable causes of mental retardation with a worldwide incidence of 1:4000 live bihs. It is usually sporadic with a 2:1 female to male preponderance. Thyroid dysgenesis is the commonest cause of permanent CH (80-85%). Thyroid hormone synthetic defects account for 10% of all cases. These are inherited as autosomal recessive disorders. The defect can lie in iodide trapping or organification, iodotyrosine coupling or deiodination and thyroglobulin synthesis or secretion. The commonest of these is a defect in the thyroid peroxidase (TPO) activity leading to impaired oxidation and organification of iodide to iodine. These disorders usually result in goitrous hypothyroidism. Majority of infants appear normal at bih. Ideally universal screening at 3-4 days of age should be done for detecting CH. Abnormal values on screening (T4 < 6.5 ug/dL, TSH >20mu/L) should be confirmed by a venous sample before initiating treatment. Term as well as preterm infants with low T4 and elevated TSH should be staed on L-thyroxine at a dose of 10-15ig/ kg/ day as soon as the diagnosis is made.

{"question": "Which of the following cancer metastasize to brain leastly: March 2011", "exp": "Ans. D: Prostatic carcinoma The 5 most common primary sites are lung, breast, skin (melanoma), kidney and gastrointestinal tract, accounting for about 80% of all metastases. Some rare tumours (e.g. choriocarcinoma) have a high likelihood of metastasizing to the brain, whereas some more common tumours (e.g. prostatic tumours) almost never grow in the brain, even when they are metastatic to adjacent bone and dura. Prostatic carcinoma Advanced prostate cancer can spread to other pas of the body, causing symptoms. The most common symptom is bone pain, often in the veebrae, pelvis, or ribs. Spread of cancer into other bones such as the femur is usually to the proximal pa of the bone. Prostate cancer in the spine can also compress the spinal cord, causing leg weakness and urinary and fecal incontinence Trophoblastic diseases They comprise a variety of biologically interrelated conditions which form a clinical spectrum consisting of four distinct clinical pathological entities like - Molar pregnancy Invasive mole - Placental site trophoblastic tumours and - Choriocarcinoma Incidence of hydatidiform mole ranges from 1 in 500 in India to 1 in 3000 in USA. Like wise malignant potential of the disease is also higher in Southeast Asia reaching as high as 10-15% compared to 2-4% in west. Some of the hydatidiform moles erode the wall of uterus, burrow into myometrium and may even burst though the uterus into peritoneum and are called invasive mole. Even though locally aggressive, invasive mole does not metastasise. On the other hand choriocarcinoma is rare but one of the most malignant neoplasms arising in the body of uterus. Choriocarcinoma metastasises readily. It is not uncommon to find secondary nodules in the cervix or vagina. The lungs, brain and liver are the distant organs more often involved. Lymph nodes are rarely the site of metastasis Brain metastases They are the most common type of brain tumors, with the total number diagnosed annually outnumbering all other intracranial tumors combined. The most common source of brain metastases in males is lung cancer and in females is breast cancer. The mechanisms by which primary tumors produce brain metastases is thought to be hematogenous spread from primary or secondary sites in the lung. Since the brain has no lymphatic system, all tumors metastasizing to the brain do so by spreading through the bloodstream. Aerial blood passes through the lungs before entering the brain, and collects tumor cells filtered out in capillaries, which subsequently embolize to the brain.

{"question": "A 60 yr old man has both HTN and DM for 10 yrs. There is reduced vision in one eye. On fundus examination there is a central bleed and the fellow eye is normal. The diagnosis is", "exp": "Diabetic retinopathy Extensively discussed with 2 Ophthalmologists Central bleed implies bleed in macula. This is what is leading to reduced vision in the involved eye. Diabetic retinopathy is the obvious choice due to following reasons: Diabetic retinopathy Among the given options macular bleed can be seen in DR only. Though DR is usually bilateral, but can be unilateral or assymetrical. Microaneurysms are the first ophthalmoscopically detectable change in diabetic retinopathy, seen as small red dots in the middle retinal layers. When these microaneurysms rupture it may give rise to an intraretinal haemorrhages. Optic neuritis Optic neuritis can be ruled out as - Vision loss is usually abrupt - Mild periorbital pain (exacerbated by eye movement) is present in about 90% cases. - Usually seen in young patients - Fundus picture is not matching. Retinal haemorrhages are uncommon. Macular bleed is never seen. Fundus examination is normal in retrobulabar type of optic neuritis (which is the much more common type of optic neuritis). In the less common papillitis type of optic neuritis, optic disc swelling is present. Funduscopic features of optic disc swelling include elevation of the optic nerve head, disk hyperemia, blurring of the disc margins, and edema of the nerve fibre layer. Optic disc hemorrhages are uncommon. Retinal tear Retinal tear are usually peripheral and typically occur in the equatorial and ora serrata regions of the retina. Peripheral retinal breaks alone do not cause loss of vision, but the associated conditions of vitreous hemorrhage and rhegmatogenous retinal detachment can result in severe visual loss. Even if retinal tear is central, will not cause macular bleed. Retinal tear can be of 2 types: traumatic and non-traumatic. Non traumatic can occur because of lattice degeneration or due to vitreous traction. Vitreous traction will lead to symptoms of flashes and associated haemorrhages would cause floaters. Hypeensive retinopathy Hypeensive retinopathy can be of 2 types- Chronic hypeensive retinopathty and Malignant acute hypeensive retinopathy. Chronic hypeensive retinopathy is usually asymptomatic. Fundus picture is - focal constriction and dilatation of the retinal aerioles, touosity of the retinal aerioles, an increase in the aeriolar light reflex, and loss of transparency of the intra-aerial blood column, aeriovenous nicking (aeriovenous nicking is a highly specific .finding and the hallmark of chronic hypeensive retinopathy), retinal hemorrhages, macular edema, and cotton-wool spots. Malignant hypeensive retinopathy is due to acutely elevated blood pressure in a patient with relatively young aerioles undefended by sclerosis. Vision loss is acute and severe. The fundus picture is dominated by edema. The entire retina may be clouded by a generalized edema which may be paicularly accentuated at the disc, resulting in a marked degree of disc edema with multiple cotton wool patches, hard exudates and retinal haemorrhages. Diabetic retinopathy and age: Diabetic retinopathy affects both young and old, as it is the diabetic age and not the chronological age that is impoant. The best predictor of diabetic retinopathy is the duration of the disease. First 5 yrs of type 1 diabetes - very low risk 5-10 yrs of type 1 diahete - 27% develop diabetic retinopathy > 10 yrs - 71 to 90 % develop diabetic retinopathy > 20-30 yrs - 95% develop DR.

Lesion at the elbow The term cubital tunnel syndrome is often used for ulnar nerve compression at the elbow. Total paralysis of the nerve, including those branches of the nerve serving the flexor digitorum profundus and flexor carpi ulnaris muscles, causes wasting along medial side of forearm. Paralysis of the nerve also leads to weakness of flexion of fouh and fifth fingers; if proximal poions of these fingers are held steady, patient is unable to flex terminal phalanges. With paralysis of hypothenar muscles, abduction of fifth finger is impossible. Paralysis of interossei and medial two lumbricals causes 'claw hand' deformity, mainly seen in the ulnar fingers. There may be wasting of hypothenar muscles, interossei and medial pa of thenar eminence. Also there is weakness in movement of fingers and abduction to the extended thumb against the palm. There is sensory loss of the dorsal and palmar aspects of the medial side of the hand together with the medial one and a half fingers.

There is a marked predilection to the axial skeleton, particularly the thoracic spine. It may also involve the peripheral joints.The most characteristic radiographic abnormality of the DISH is calcification and ossification of the anterior longitudinal ligament of the spine.The diagnosis is made by spinal radiographs that show \"flowing\" calcifications along the anterior and lateral portion of at least four contiguous vertebral bodies without loss of disc height and without typical radiographic findings of ankylosing spondylitis, (no syndesmophytes).A DISH commonly occurs in men in their fifth to sixth decade of life.Patients are often asymptomatic but may have spinal pain or limited spinal motion.The DISH can be ruled out as in DISH there is no raised ESR and syndesmophytes. (ESR is raised in inflammatory spondyloarthropathies like Ankylosing spondylitis.

A single IgM can initiate the pathway, while multiple IgGs are needed. This also occurs when Clq binds directly to the surface of the pathogen. Such binding leads to conformational changes in the C1q molecule, which leads to the activation of two Clr molecules. C1r is a serine protease. They then cleave Cls (another serine protease).

{"question": "False about case fatality rate: March 2011", "exp": "Ans. B: Denominator is mid-year population Case fatality rate= Total number of deaths due to a disease X 100/ Total number of cases due to that disease Case fatality/Fatality rate: It is the ratio of deaths within a designated population of people with a paicular condition, over a ceain period of time. An example of a fatality rate would be 9 deaths per 10,000 people at risk per year. This means that within a given year, out of 10,000 people formally diagnosed with a disease, 9 died. Rabies, if contracted by an unvaccinated individual who does not seek prophylactic treatment, is also an extremely deadly virus, with a case fatality rate approaching 100%. Moality rate: It is a measure of the number of deaths (in general, or due to a specific cause) in a population, scaled to the size of that population, per unit time. Moality rate is typically expressed in units of deaths per 1000 individuals per year; thus, a moality rate of 9.5 in a population of 100,000 would mean 950 deaths per year in that entire population, or 0.95% out of the total. It is distinct from morbidity rate, which refers to the number of individuals in poor health during a given time period (the prevalence rate) or the number of newly appearing cases of the disease per unit of time (incidence rate). The term \"moality\" is also sometimes inappropriately used to refer to the number of deaths among a set of diagnosed hospital cases for a disease or injury, rather than for the general population of a country or ethnic group. This disease moality statistic is more precisely referred to as \"case fatality\". One Distinguishes: The crude death rate, the total number of deaths per year per 1000 people. The perinatal moality rate, the sum of neonatal deaths and fetal deaths (stillbihs) per 1000 bihs. The maternal moality ratio, the number of maternal deaths per 100,000 live bihs in same time period. The maternal moality rate, the number of maternal deaths per 1,000 women of reproductive age in the population (generally defined as 15-44 years of age). The infant moality rate, the number of deaths of children less than 1 year old per 1000 live bihs. The child moality rate, the number of deaths of children less than 5 years old per 1000 live bihs. The standardized moality rate (SMR)- This represents a propoional comparison to the numbers of deaths that would have been expected if the population had been of a standard composition in terms of age, gender, etc. The age specific moality rate (ASMR) - This refers to the total number of deaths per year per 1000 people of a given age.", "cop": 2, "opa": "Represents the killing power of disease", "opb": "Denominator is mid-year population", "opc": "Indicates virulence power of causative agent", "opd": "Not much useful for chronic diseases", "subject_name": "Social & Preventive Medicine", "topic_name": null, "id": "a1f2c84d-ba32-4c8e-a5bd-259ac867a9fe", "choice_type": "multi", "temporal_label": "None"}

{"question": "Drug of choice for sedation of a patient in ICU is: September 2009, March 2013 (a)", "exp": "Ans. C: Propofol Benzodiazepines, e.g. diazepam, lorazepam and midazolam, are widely used as sedative agents in the ICU. Diazepam use has become less common as newer shoer-acting benzodiazepines have become available. Lorazepam is more potent than midazolam and, because of its low lipid solubility, crosses the blood-brain barrier more slowly, delaying its onset of action and prolonging the sedative effect. Hence, it is recommended for longer-term sedation while midazolam is preferred for sho-term sedation Propofol, another frequently used sedative agent, resembles midazolam in terms of pharmacological profile. Midazolam and propofol have similar efficacy and safety in sedating various groups of critically ill patients. Midazolam is, however, cheaper than propofol Neveheless, propofol, when used as a sedative in mechanically ventilated patients, is associated with shoer weaning times and hence, while midazolam may be cheaper, the overall cost-benefit analysis taking into account duration of mechanical ventilation and ICU stay may in fact be better with propofol.", "cop": 3, "opa": "Diazepam", "opb": "Lorazepam", "opc": "Propofol", "opd": "Alprazolam", "subject_name": "Anaesthesia", "topic_name": null, "id": "32790a09-f519-4c46-9354-5bb020b75db3", "choice_type": "single", "temporal_label": "None"}

Bowel stimulants such as laxatives or enemas should not be administered. Pregnant women are predisposed to constipation secondary to decreased bowel motility induced by elevated levels of progesterone. The symptoms of nausea and emesis in this patient and the presence of a low-grade fever prompt further workup because her presentation is not consistent with uncomplicated constipation. In pregnancy, constipation can be treated with hydration, increased fiber in the diet, and the use of stool softeners. The patient's sudden onset of emesis and abdominal pain is not consistent with the normal presentation of hyperemesis gravidarum. Hyperemesis typically has an onset in the early part of the first trimester and usually resolves by 16 weeks. It is characterized by intractable vomiting causing severe weight loss, dehydration, and electrolyte imbalance. The ingestion of spicy foods during pregnancy can cause or exacerbate gastric reflux or \"heartburn\" but would not cause the severity of the symptoms described in this patient's presentation. Dyspepsia during pregnancy can be treated with antacids.

{"question": "A 65-year-old woman with history of type 2 diabetes mellitus for the last 8 years dies in a hospital She had no other significant medical history. Which of the following is the most likely cause of her death?", "exp": "Despite all the treatments now available, the outcome for patients with diabetes remains disappointing. Longterm complications of diabetes still cause significant morbidity and moality (Boxes 21.31 and 21.32). Excess moality in diabetes is caused mainly by large blood vessel disease, paicularly myocardial infarction and stroke. Macrovascular disease also causes substantial morbidity from myocardial infarction, stroke, angina, cardiac failure and intermittent claudication. The pathological changes of atherosclerosis in diabetic patients are similar to those in the non-diabetic population but occur earlier in life and are more extensive and severe. Diabetes amplifies the effects of the other major cardiovascular risk factors: smoking, hypeension and dyslipidaemia (Fig. 21.11). Moreover, patients with type 2 diabetes are more likely to have additional cardiovascular risk factors, which co-segregate with insulin resistance in the metabolic syndrome (p. 805). Disease of small blood vessels is a specific complication of diabetes and is termed diabetic microangiopathy. It contributes to moality through renal failure caused by diabetic nephropathy, and is responsible for substantial morbidity and disability: for example, blindness from diabetic retinopathy, difficulty in walking, chronic ulceration of the feet from peripheral neuropathy, and bowel and bladder dysfunction from autonomic neuropathy. The risk of microvascular disease is positively correlated with the duration and degree of sustained hyperglycaemia, however caused and at whatever age it develops.

Recurrent cystitis or pyelonephritis, abnormal urinary stream, and hematuria also should initiate a workup for vesicovaginal fistula. The time from initial insult to clinical presentation depends on the etiology of the vesicovaginal fistula. A vesicovaginal fistula secondary to a bladder laceration typically presents immediately. Approximately 90% of genitourinary fistulas associated with pelvic surgery are symptomatic within 7-30 days postoperatively.

It can cause relatively long episodes of hypoglycemia; this is one reason why shoer-acting sulfonylureas such as gliclazide or tolbutamide are used instead. The risk of hypoglycemia makes this drug a poor choice for the elderly and patients with mild to moderate hepatic and renal impairment. Chlorpropamide and other sulphonylureas encourage weight gain, so they are generally not ored for use in very obese patients. Metformin is considered a better drug for these patients.

Crisis of weakness involving respiratory muscles was the most frequent cause of death before the advent of positive pressure respirators. The disease is autoimmune-mediated and results from autoantibodies to the muscular nicotinic receptors. Besides the pharmacologic test, a progressive decrease in the amplitude of muscle potential is the diagnostic feature of myasthenia gravis. Electromyography is therefore very useful in the diagnosis of this condition. Blood, urine, and CSF analysis are entirely within normal limits in myasthenia gravis, although they are indeed frequently performed in the initial screening. MRI of the head and EEG recording would be entirely useless in this setting.

Elevated blood pressure alone, in the absence of symptoms or end organ damage, rarely requires emergency therapy. The therapy for a hypeensive emergency requires IMMEDIATE LOWERING of the blood pressure by approximately 20-30 mm Hg by intravenous administration of medication. The blood pressure should not be reduced to normotensive levels because of the risk of watershed cerebral infarcts with such a dramatic reduction.

Candidiasis is a fungal infection common in women of childbearing age that results in pruritus, with a thick, white vaginal discharge. Patients often have a history of recurrent yeast infections or recent antibiotic treatment. Symptoms of candidiasis often begin just before menses. Precipitating factors include immunosuppression, diabetes mellitus, pregnancy, and hormone replacement therapy. Candidiasis is usually not contracted from a sexual paner. Seventy-five percent of all women have one episode of candidiasis in their lifetime. Recurrent episodes may indicate underlying immunodeficiency or diabetes. Trichomoniasis is associated with risk factors for other sexually transmitted diseases (STDs); elicit a history of multiple sexual paners.

Hypothalamic D2 receptor blockade results in an elevated temperature set point and impairment of heat-dissipating mechanisms.Peripherally, antipsychotics lead to increased calcium release from the sarcoplasmic reticulum, resulting in increased contractility, which can contribute to hypehermia, rigidity, and muscle cell breakdown.", "cop": 3, "opa": "Antidepressants", "opb": "Anxiolytics", "opc": "Antipsychotics", "opd": "Antiepileptics", "subject_name": "Psychiatry", "topic_name": null, "id": "7a0d18a7-433d-445f-b68e-695b79afe3cd", "choice_type": "single", "temporal_label": "None"}

B i.e. Railway accidents Railway spine It was a nineteenth-century diagnosis for the post-traumatic symptoms of passengers involved in railroad accidents. The first full length medical study of the condition was John Eric Erichsen's classic book, On Railway and Other Injuries of the Nervous System. For this reason, railway spine is often known as \"Erichsen's disease\". Railway collisions were a frequent occurrence in the early 19th century. Exacerbating the problem was the fact that railway cars were flimsy, wooden structures with no protection for the occupants Soon a group of people staed coming forward who claimed that they had been injured in train crashes, but had no obvious evidence of injury. The railroads rejected these claims as fake. The nature of symptoms caused by \"railway spine\" was hotly debated in the late 19th century, notably at the meetings of the (Austrian) Imperial Society of Physicians in Vienna, 1886. Germany's leading neurologist, Hermann Oppenheim, claimed that all railway spine symptoms were due to physical damage to the spine or brain, whereas French and British scholars, notably Jean-Main Charcot and Herbe Page, insisted that some symptoms could be caused by hysteria (now known as conversion disorder). Erichsen observed that those most likely to be injured in a railway crash were those sitting with their backs to the acceleration. This is the same injury mechanism found in whiplash.

When symptomatic, pain is the most frequent symptom of either spondylolysis or spondylolisthesis There are several different etiologies for spondylolisthesis: Spondylolytic spondylolisthesis is the most common type and results from bilateral defects in the pars interaicularis. Degenerative spondylolisthesis -Most frequent at the L4-L5 level It is not the result of a pars defect but a complex interaction between the disk, facets joints and the ligamentous structures Dysplastic spondylolisthesis-Results from congenital abnormalities of the body and/or facets in the lumbar region such that the alignment of the facets allows spondylolisthesis to occur.

Septicum and Cl. novyi Crepitus A sound can be created when two rough surfaces in the human body come into contact-- for example, in osteoahritis or rheumatoid ahritis when the cailage around joints has eroded away and the joint ends grind against one another When the fracture surfaces of two broken bones rub together, it produces a sound. Crepitus is a common sign of bone fracture. In soft tissues, crepitus can be produced when gas is introduced into an area where it normally isn't present. The term can also be used when describing the sounds produced by lung conditions such as interstitial lung disease--these are also referred to as \"rales\". Crepitus is often loud enough to be heard by the human ear, although a stethoscope may be needed to detect instances caused by respiratory diseases. In times of poor surgical practice, post-surgical complications involved anaerobic infection by Clostridium perfringens strains, which can cause gas gangrene in tissues, also giving rise to crepitus. Subcutaneous crepitus (or surgical emphysema) is a crackling sound resulting from subcutaneous emphysema, or air trapped in the subcutaneous tissues. Subcutaneous emphysema/ SCE/ SE/ Tissue emphysema/ Sub Q air It occurs when gas or air is present in the subcutaneous layer of the skin. Subcutaneous refers to the tissue beneath the cutis of the skin, and emphysema refers to trapped air. Since the air generally comes from the chest cavity, subcutaneous emphysema usually occurs on the chest, neck and face, where it is able to travel from the chest cavity along the fascia.

D: Soft contact lens users Acanthamoebic keratitis is frequently associated with the wearing of soft contact lenses. Acanthamoeba keratitis It is a rare disease in which amoebae invade the cornea of the eye In developed countries, it is nearly always associated with contact lens use, as Acanthamoeba can survive in the space between the lens and the eye. For this reason, contact lenses must be properly disinfected before wearing, and should be removed when swimming or surfing. However, elsewhere in the world, many cases of Acanthamoeba present in non-contact lens wearers To detect Acanthamoeba on a contact lens in a laboratory, a sheep blood agar plate with a layer (a lawn) of E. coli is made. Pa of the contact lens is placed on the agar plate. If Acanthamoeba are present, they will ingest the bacteria, leaving a clear patch on the plate around the area of the lens. Polymerase chain reaction can also be used to confirm a diagnosis of Acanthamoeba keratitis, especially when contact lenses are not involved. Acanthameoba is also characterized by a brawny edema and hazy view into the interior AC.

Classical lichen planus is characterized by shiny, flat-topped, firm papules (bumps) varying from pin point size ('guttate') to larger than a centimetre. They are a purple colour and often are crossed by fine white lines (called 'Wickham's striae'). They may be close together or widespread, or grouped in lines (linear lichen planus) or rings (annular lichen planus). Linear lichen planus can be the result of scratching or injuring the skin. Although sometimes there are no symptoms, it is often very itchy. Lichen planus may affect any area, but is most often seen on the front of the wrists, lower back, and ankles.

The overall effect is therefore retention of water in excess of solute; consequently, the effective osmotic pressure of the body fluids is decreased.

Syndesmophvtes Syndesmophytes are thin, slender veical radiodense spicules bridging the veebral bodies, giving the spine `bamboo' appearance.

Syndesmophytes are seen in: - Ankylosing spondylitis - Psoriatic ahritis - Reiter's disease - Ahritis assoc. with Inflammatory bowel disease Before discussing A.S. lets see other options: Diffuse idiopathic skeletal hyperostosis (DISH): Also k/a Forestier's disease, ankylosing hyperostosis DISH is a syndrome of excessive calcification and ossification of soft tissues. mainly ligaments and entheses, that develops with aging. There is a marked predilection to the axial skeleton, paicularly the thoracic spine. It may also involve the peripheral joints. The most characteristic radiographic abnormality of DISH is calcification and ossification of the anterior longitudinal ligament of the spine. The diagnosis is made by, spinal radiographs that show \"flowing\" calcifications along the anterior and lateral poion of at least four contiguous veebral bodies without loss of disc height and without typical radiographic findings of ankylosing spondylitis. (no syndesmophytes). DISH commonly occurs in men in their fifth to sixth decade of life. Patients are often asymptomatic but may have spinal pain or limited spinal motion. DISH can be ruled out as in DISH there is no raised ESR and syndesmophytes. (ESR is raised in inflammatory spondyloahropathies like Ankylosing spondylitis. But DISH and degenerative osteoahritis are non-inflammatory conditions, so ESR would be normal.) Apley's writes- \"Although DISH bears a superficial resemblance to AS, it is not an inflammatory disease; spinal pain and stiffness are seldom severe, the sacroilitis joints are not eroded and the ESR is normal.\" Harrison writes- \"Diffuse idiopathic skeletal hyperostosis which occurs in middle aged and elderly is usually not symptomatic.\" Degenerative osteoahritis of spine: It is a disease of elderly characterised by formation of large osteophytes along the anterior and lateral aspects of spine with decreased interveebral disc spaces.

Chronic otitis externa (Ref: Dhingra 4th/105-106, 54)Chronic Otitis ExternaChronic otitis externa is ac chronic infection/inflammation involving the skin lining of the external canal.There is thickening of skin lining of the external canal due to persistent low grade infection/inflammation.Etiolgy:Caused primarily by repeated local irritation, most commonly arising from persistent drainage from a chronic middle ear infection.Other causes of repeated irritation, such as insertion of cotton swabs or other foreign objects into the ear canal, can lead to this condition, as can rare chronic infections such as syphilis, tuberculosis, and leprosy.Clinical Features:Unrelenting pruritus, mild painPresence of dry skin in the external canalAsteatosis (lack of cerumen), hypertrophic external canal skin, presence of dry flaky skin in the external canalMild tenderness on ear manipulationRarely mucopurulent otorrheaManagement:Treatment: Extensive use of acetic acid ear drops helps to reduce the pH of skin lining the external canal making it more resistant to bacterial infections.Surgery is indicated in extreme cases. A canaloplasty is performed to widen the external canal. The involved skin may be removed to be replaced by a split thickness graft.Carcinoma External Auditory CanalMost commonly squamous cell carcinomaMost commonly seen in cases of long standing ear dischargeMay arise primarily from the meatus or a secondary extension from the middle ear carcinomaClinical Features:Blood staining of hitherto mucopurulent or purulent discharge and severe headacheExamination:Ulcerated area in the meatus or a bleeding polypoidal mass or granulationsFacial nerve may be paralysed because of local extension of disease through posterior meatal wall or its spread into middle earRegional lymph nodes (preauricular, postauricular, infra-auricular and upper deep cervical)Treatment:En-bloc wide surgical excision with post-operative radiation.Keratosis ObturansCollection of pearly white mass of desquamated epithelial cells in the deep meatus is called keratosis obturans.By its pressure effects causes absorption of bone leading to widening of meatus so much sothat facial nerve may be exposed and paralysed.Commonly seen between 5-20 years of ageMay affect one or both earsEtiology:Sometimes associated with bronchiectasis and chronic sinusitisNormally epithelium from surface of tympanic membrane migrates onto the posterior meatal wall.

{"question": "A 36 year old male presents with a complaint of passing dark-reddish urine. He states that yesterday he played basketball for 4 hours, which was the first time he had exercised in 4 months. He awoke this morning with sore muscles and discolored urine. Physical examination is unremarkable. The urine is reddish-brown in color; dipstick test for blood is positive, the pH is 5.1, the specific gravity 1.03. Microscopic examination of the urine reveals no red blood cells. What is the most likely etiology for this presentation?", "exp": "The appearance of a dark-reddish urine is suggestive of a number of conditions, including hematuria; however, there are no red blood cells present on microscopic examination. Fuhermore, the dipstick test for blood is positive, which is suggestive of myoglobinuria. Myoglobin is a pigment that, if present in the urine, will produce a positive dipstick test, even in the absence of red blood cells. Myoglobinuria can be caused when an unconditioned individual paakes in intense physical exeion. This extreme physical activity leads to muscle cell breakdown and the release of myoglobin into the blood, which is then filtered by the kidneys and excreted into the urine. If there was hemolyzed blood in the urine , a few red blood cells should have been detected on urinalysis. Ingestion of foods that contained red dye can discolor the urine; however, it would not produce a positive dipstick test.

{"question": "Drug of choice for lymphogranuloma venerum: March 2005", "exp": "Ans. A: Tetracycline Lymphogranuloma venereum (LGV) is a sexually transmitted infection caused by unique serovars of Chlamydia trachomatis (L1, L2, L3) that are unlike those that typically cause urethritis, cervicitis, and proctitis (A-K). The hallmark of LGV is unilateral or bilateral tender lymphadenopathy that dramatically evolves 2 to 6 weeks after the primary lesion. The involved lymph nodes increase rapidly in size, and pain and erythema are common. If adjacent to one another, several involved lymph nodes may coalesce. The central areas of such lymph nodes can then undergo necrosis. Fluctuant and suppurative lymph nodes then develop, causing the classic 'bubo' of LGV. The bubo may then rupture and drain purulent material, which is associated with relief from symptoms. The 'groove sign' characteristic of LGV is seen if both the inguinal and the femoral nodes are involved. Tetracycline is the first choice drugs for LGV.

{"question": "A viral organism was isolated from a painful blister on the lip of a teenage girl. The agent was found to double-stranded, linear DNA and was enveloped. The patient had a similar sore approximately 2 months ago. Which of the following is the most likely causative organism?", "exp": "Herpes simplex is an enveloped, linear DNA virus that is a very common infectious agent; most adults will have anti-Herpes simplex antibodies in their serum, although many may not have ever had any clinical signs of disease. The hallmark of this disease is painful skin vesicles often called \"cold\" sores, or \"fever\" blisters to denote the precipitating event that preceded the appearance of the lesions. The virus has a propensity to become latent in the host, finding safe refuge in nervous tissue. Activation of the infection occurs following mild trauma (e.g., a visit to the dentist), hormonal changes (e.g., menses), and immunosuppression (e.g., following organ transplantation). Other, more serious, manifestations of disease include encephalitis, pneumonia, and hepatitis; these are paicularly likely to be seen in immunodeficient patients such as those with AIDS. Adenoviruses are naked, linear, double-stranded DNA viruses that cause acute, usually self-limiting, influenza-like illnesses occurring in winter. The symptoms include pharyngitis, fever, cough, and general malaise. Epidemic pharyngoconjunctivitis and pneumonia can occur in closed populations such as military installations. Coxsackie viruses are naked, single-stranded, polycistronic viruses with an RNA genome. They are divided into groups A and B based on their virulence in suckling mice. Coxsackie A group causes generalized myositis and flaccid paralysis, which is rapidly fatal to infant mice, whereas group B produces less severe lesions of the hea, pancreas, and central nervous system. In man, Coxsackie A causes herpangina and hand-foot-and-mouth disease, while Coxsackie B is seen in patients with pleurodynia, myocarditis, and pericarditis. Both groups cause upper respiratory infections, febrile rashes, and meningitis. Herpes zoster, the varicella virus, is an enveloped, double-stranded DNA virus that is a very common infectious agent in children. Chickenpox is a mild, self-limiting illness in children that is evidenced as a fever followed by a macular rash that progresses to papules, then vesicles of the skin and mucous membranes. Shingles is a recurrence of a previously latent varicella infection in which the virus has taken refuge in sensory ganglia of spinal or cranial nerves. Various factors that decrease the immune status of the patient contribute to the exacerbation of the infection. Severe dermatomal pain occurs with a vesicular eruption, fever, and malaise.

{"question": "Torsion of testes is may be due to: March 2013 (e, f)", "exp": "Ans. D i.e. All of the above Testicular torsion It is the torsion of the spermatic cord structures and subsequent loss of the blood supply to the ipsilateral testicle. This is a urological emergency; early diagnosis and treatment are vital to saving the testicle and preserving future feility. Testicular torsion is primarily a disease of adolescents and neonates. It is the most common cause of testicular loss in these age groups. Surgical treatment may prevent fuher ischemic damage to the testis. Testicular torsion is caused by twisting of the spermatic cord and the blood supply to the testicle. With mature attachments, the tunica vaginalis is attached securely to the posterior lateral aspect of the testicle, and, within it, the spermatic cord is not very mobile. If the attachment of the tunica vaginalis to the testicle is inappropriately high, the spermatic cord can rotate within it, which can lead to intravaginal torsion. This defect is referred to as the bell clapper deformity. This occurs in about 17 % of males and is bilateral in 40%. Intravaginal torsion most commonly occurs in adolescents. It is thought that the increased weight of the testicle after pubey, as well as sudden contraction of the cremasteric muscles (which inses in a spiral fashion into the spermatic cord), is the impetus for acute torsion. By contrast, neonates more often have extravaginal torsion. This occurs because the tunica vaginalis is not yet secured to the gubernaculum and, therefore, the spermatic cord, as well as the tunica vaginalis, undergo torsion as a unit. Extravaginal torsion is not associated with bell clapper deformity. This can occur up to months prior to bih. Of course, neonates can have intravaginal torsion and this should be managed in the same manner as adolescents. Testicular torsion is associated with testicular malignancy, especially in adults According to Prehn's sign, the physical lifting of the testicles relieves the pain of epididymitis but not pain caused by testicular torsion", "cop": 4, "opa": "Trauma to testes", "opb": "Full coverage of the testis with tunica vaginalis", "opc": "Long mesorchium", "opd": "All of the above", "subject_name": "Surgery", "topic_name": null, "id": "613871c9-b846-4222-8f28-54bcb62e28e2", "choice_type": "multi", "temporal_label": "None"}

Staging The stages are assessed as follows: Stage I - Cancer has only affected the glans and/or foreskin. Stage II - Cancer has spread to the shaft of the penis. Stage III - Cancer has affected the penis and surrounding lymph nodes. Stage IV - Cancer has moved beyond the groin area to other pas of the body. Recurrent - Cancer that has returned after treatment. The most common treatment is one of five types of surgery: Wide local excision - The tumor and some surrounding healthy tissue are removed Microsurgery - Surgery performed with a microscope is used to remove the tumor and as little healthy tissue as possible Laser surgery - laser light is used to burn or cut away cancerous cells Circumcision - cancerous foreskin is removed Amputation (penectomy) - a paial or total removal of the penis, and possibly the associated lymph nodes. This is the most common and effective treatment. Radiation therapy is usually used adjuvantly with surgery to reduce the risk of recurrence.

Adenocarcinomas tend to aggressively invade the gastric wall, infiltrating the muscularis mucosae, the submucosa, and thence the muscularis propria.Intestinal type adenocarcinoma tumor cells describe irregular tubular structures, harboring pluristratification, multiple lumens, reduced stroma (\"back to back\" aspect). Often, it associates intestinal metaplasia in neighboring mucosa. Depending on glandular architecture, cellular pleomorphism and mucosecretion, adenocarcinoma may present 3 degrees of differentiation: well, moderate and poorly differentiate.Diffuse type adenocarcinoma (mucinous, colloid, linitis plastica, leather-bottle stomach) Tumor cells are discohesive and secrete mucus which is delivered in the interstitium producing large pools of mucus/colloid (optically \"empty\" spaces).

{"question": "Pathognomic lesion in HIV is: September 2011", "exp": "Ans. B : Oral leukoplakia Oral hairy leukoplakia is viually pathognomic of HIV disease in the context of HIV risk factors. AIDS and HIV Infection with HIV-1 is associated with a progressive decrease of the CD4+ T cell count and an increase in viral load, the level of HIV in the blood. The stage of infection can be determined by measuring the patient's CD4+ T cell count and viral load. The stages of HIV infection are acute infection (also known as primary infection), latency and AIDS. Acute infection lasts for several weeks and may include symptoms such as fever, lymphadenopathy, pharyngitis, rash, myalgia, malaise, and mouth and esophageal sores. The latency stage involves few or no symptoms and can last anywhere from two weeks to twenty years or more, depending on the individual. AIDS, the final stage of HIV infection, is defined by low CD4+ T cell counts (fewer than 200 per microliter), various oppounistic infections, cancers and other conditions. When CD4+ T cell numbers decline below a critical level of 200 cells per uL, cell-mediated immunity is lost, and infections with a variety of oppounistic microbes appear. The first symptoms often include moderate and unexplained weight loss, recurring respiratory tract infections (such as sinusitis, bronchitis, otitis media, pharyngitis), prostatitis, skin rashes, and oral ulcerations. Common oppounistic infections and tumors, most of which are normally controlled by robust CD4+ T cell-mediated immunity then sta to affect the patient. Typically, resistance is lost early on to oral Candida species and to Mycobacterium tuberculosis, which leads to an increased susceptibility to oral candidiasis (thrush) and tuberculosis. Later, reactivation of latent herpes viruses may cause worsening recurrences of herpes simplex eruptions, shingles, Epstein-Barr virus-induced B-cell lymphomas, or Kaposi's sarcoma.

{"question": "Auspitz sign is seen in: March 2007, September 2010", "exp": "Ans. A: Psoriasis Psoriasis involves hyperproliferation of the keratinocytes in the epidermis. Psoriasis is associated with ceain human leukocyte antigen (HLA) alleles, paicularly human leukocyte antigen Cw6 (HLA-Cw6). Clinical findings: The skin almost always is affected before the eyes. Ocular findings occur in approximately 10% of the patients. The nonocular symptoms are related to rash and psoriatic ahritis: - Psoriatic ahritis can cause stiffness, pain, throbbing, swelling, or tenderness of the joints. - The distal joints, such as the fingers, toes, wrists, knees, and ankles, are affected most often. The most common ocular symptoms are redness and tearing due to conjunctivitis or blepharitis. Corneal involvement -The most common finding is punctate keratitis. Uvea: Usually, anterior uveitis can be seen in association with psoriatic ahritis. The most common skin manifestations are scaling erythematous macules, papules, and plaques. The most common type of psoriasis is chronic stationary psoriasis (psoriasis vulgaris). This involves the scalp, extensor surfaces, genitals, umbilicus, and lumbosacral and retroauricular regions. Psoriasis inversa: It involves flexural surfaces and interiginous areas, and it is not associated with scaling. Eruptive psoriasis: It involves the upper trunk and upper extremities. Most often, it is seen in younger patients. Other forms: Psoriatic erythroderma is a generalized form. When the scales are removed, small droplets of blood appear within a few seconds; this is known as the Auspitz sign.

{"question": "Nasal angiofibroma of nose is common in: March 2011", "exp": "Ans. A: Young Males Nasopharyngeal fibroma/ juvenile nasopharyngeal angiofibroma is seen almost exclusively in males in the age group of 10-20 years Nasopharyngeal angiofibroma (also called juvenile nasopharyngeal angiofibroma) It is a histologically benign but locally aggressive vascular tumor that grows in the back of the nasal cavity. It most commonly affects adolescent males. Patients with nasopharyngeal angiofibroma usually present with one-sided nasal obstruction and recurrent bleeding. Frequent chronic epistaxis (Nose-Bleeds) or blood-tinged nasal discharge Nasal obstruction and rhinorrhea Conductive hearing loss from eustachian-tube obstruction Diplopia, which occurs secondary to erosion into the cranial cavity and pressure on the optic chiasma If nasopharyngeal angiofibroma is suspected based on physical exam (a smooth submucosal mass in the posterior nasal cavity), imaging studies such as CT or MRI should be performed. Biopsy can lead to extensive bleeding since the tumor is composed of blood vessels without a muscular coat. Differential diagnosis Antro-choanal polyp (benign neoplasm) Rhinosporidiosis (as bleeding point is here too) Malignancy - nasopharyngeal carcinoma, lymphoma, plasmacytoma, rhabdomyosarcoma Chordoma Nasopharyngeal cyst Pyogenic granuloma Treatment Medical treatment is usually given before surgery to reduce the blood loss - includes the usage of Diethylstilbestrol 2-3 weeks before surgery to make the surgery less vascular. Nasopharyngeal angiofibroma is sometimes treated by surgery. Pre-surgery angiography may allow for embolization, reducing intraoperative blood loss. Hypotensive Anaesthesia is the usual modality followed to reduce blood loss. Patients with tumors that have extended into the cranial cavity or whose tumors can't be safely reached by surgery may receive radiation therapy. Also Radiation therapy helps in case where recurrence is the main problem. Endoscopy has recently been used in patients with tumors of limited extension that have been pre-operatively embolized.", "cop": 1, "opa": "Younger males", "opb": "Younger females", "opc": "Young adults", "opd": "Adolescents of both sexes", "subject_name": "ENT", "topic_name": null, "id": "593e8736-defb-41b9-9c89-0abdd7dbce9e", "choice_type": "multi", "temporal_label": "None"}

{"question": "A 47-year-old woman is brought to the hospital by her husband with fever, headache, confusion, and jaundice for 1 week. She underwent a hysterectomy 2 months ago and began estrogen replacement therapy recently. On admission, her temperature is 38.7 C (102 F), blood pressure is 140/90 mm Hg, Pulse is 98/min, and Respiratory rate is 20/min. She appears disoriented to time and place. Physical examination reveals jaundiced sclerae and skin, purpura on the trunk, and bleeding gums. Her platelet count is 25,000/mm3, hematocrit is 24%, and creatinine is 4.9 mg/dL. Lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and indirect bilirubin are elevated. Coagulation tests are within normal limits, but the bleeding time is increased; fibrin-split products and Coombs test are negative. A peripheral blood smear shows schistocytes, helmet-shaped cells, and cells with a triangular shape. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?", "exp": "Thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP) is a rare disorder of unknown etiology. It is characterized by an increased bleeding time but a decreased platelet count. It causes purpura, fever, renal failure, microangiopathic hemolytic anemia, and microthrombi, frequently in young women. Elevated indirect bilirubin and high LDH are characteristic, as are schistocytes in the blood smear, renal dysfunction, and neurologic and systemic symptoms. Negative findings impoant to rule out similar conditions include a negative Coombs test and absence of fibrin split products. TTP is thought to be initiated by endothelial injury, which releases ceain procoagulant materials into the circulation, causing platelet aggregation. This condition may be precipitated by pregnancy or use of estrogens. Autoimmune hemolytic anemia can cause anemia and an elevated indirect bilirubin, but generally produces only mild symptoms, is not associated with thrombocytopenia, and does not cause fragmentation of red blood cells on the peripheral smear. The negative Coombs test argues against autoimmune hemolytic anemia. Disseminated intravascular coagulation can be differentiated from TTP because of abnormal coagulation tests. In DIC, microangiopathic hemolysis is also present, but the prothrombin time (PT) and paial thromboplastin time (PTT) are prolonged, fibrinogen levels are reduced, and fibrin split products are elevated. Hemolytic-uremic syndrome is not significantly different from TTP. The two conditions, in fact, are considered manifestations of the same pathogenetic spectrum.

This increase is typical of anemia of chronic disease. In this case, the chronic disease is rheumatoid arthritis. Underlying chronic inflammatory or neoplastic diseases increases the secretion of cytokines such as interleukin-1, tumor necrosis factor, and interferon-g. These cytokines promote the sequestration of iron in storage compartments and depress erythropoietin production. Autoantibody hemolytic anemias occur in several autoimmune diseases, such as systemic lupus erythematosus, but not usually in patients with rheumatoid arthritis, as in this case. Normal serum haptoglobin rules out intravascular hemolysis; iron is recycled at a rapid rate. Impaired synthesis of b-globin chains gives rise to b-thalassemia, also characterized by hemolysis. Complement lysis is enhanced in paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria, which results from mutations in the PIGA gene. Patients with this disorder have a history of infections. Sequestration of RBCs in the spleen occur when RBC membranes are abnormal, as in hereditary spherocytosis or sickle cell anemia, or RBCs are coated by antibodies, as in autoimmune hemolytic anemias.

{"question": "Which of the following does not result in optic neuritis: September 2011", "exp": "Ans. B: Hypeension Aetiology of optic neuritis includes immune mediated disorders (local-sympathetic ophthalmitis and systemic-sarcoidosis), metabolic disorders-diabetes etc. Optic neuritis It is the inflammation of the optic nerve that may cause a complete or paial loss of vision. Causes The optic nerve comprises axons that emerge from the retina of the eye and carry visual information to the primary visual nuclei, most of which is relayed to the occipital coex of the brain to be processed into vision. Inflammation of the optic nerve causes loss of vision usually because of the swelling and destruction of the myelin sheath covering the optic nerve. The most common etiology is multiple sclerosis. The presence of demyelinating white matter lesions on brain MRI at the time of presentation of optic neuritis is the strongest predictor for developing clinically definite MS. Some other causes of optic neuritis include infection (e.g. Syphilis, Lyme disease, herpes zoster), autoimmune disorders (e.g. lupus), Inflammatory Bowel Disease, drug induced (e.g. chloramphenicol, Ethambutol) vasculitis and diabetes Symptoms Major symptoms are sudden loss of vision (paial or complete), or sudden blurred or \"foggy\" vision, and pain on movement of the affected eye. The vision might also look \"disturbed/blackened\" rather than blurry, like when feeling dizzy. Many patients with optic neuritis may lose some of their color vision in the affected eye (especially red), with colors appearing subtly washed out compared to the other eye. On medical examination the head of the optic nerve can easily be visualised by an ophthalmoscope; however frequently there is no abnormal appearance of the nerve head in optic neuritis (in cases of retrobulbar optic neuritis), though it may be swollen in some patients (anterior papillitis or more extensive optic neuritis). In many cases, only one eye is affected and patients may not be aware of the loss of color vision until the doctor asks them to close or cover the healthy eye. Epidemiology Optic neuritis typically affects young adults ranging from 18-45 years of age, with a mean age of 30-35 years. There is a strong female predominance. Treatment and prognosis In most cases, visual functions return to near normal within eight to ten weeks, but they may also advance to a complete and permanent state of visual loss. Therefore, systemic intravenous treatment with coicosteroids, which may quicken the healing of the optic nerve, is often recommended Very occasionally, if there is concomitant increased intracranial pressure, the sheath around the optic nerve may be cut to decrease the pressure. When optic neuritis is associated with MRI lesions suggestive of multiple sclerosis (MS) then general immunosuppressive therapy for MS is most often prescribed (IV methylprednisolone may shoen attacks; initial only oral prednisone may increase relapse rate).", "cop": 2, "opa": "Diabetes", "opb": "Hypeension", "opc": "Sympathetic ophthalmitis", "opd": "Sarcoidosis", "subject_name": "Ophthalmology", "topic_name": null, "id": "fdde507e-7e87-4084-9eee-f04c92ba7930", "choice_type": "single", "temporal_label": "None"}

They are used in most small glass vacuum tubes, but are rarely used in high-power tubes since they are vulnerable to high voltages and oxygen ions, and undergo rapid degradation under such conditions. Hot cathodes may be either directly heated, where the filament itself is the source of electrons, or indirectly heated, where the filament is electrically insulated from the cathode; this configuration minimizes the introduction of hum when the filament is energized with alternating current.

Therapy must be directed at increasing cardiac output without creating too high a myocardial O2 demand on the already failing hea. Administration of nitroglycerin could be expected to reduce both preload and afterload, but, if given without an inotrope, it would create unacceptable hypotension. Nitroprusside similarly would achieve afterload reduction but would result in hypotension if not accompanied by an inotropic agent.

D: Primary Sclerosing Cholangitis resolves after total colectomy Primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC) is a form of cholangitis due to an autoimmune reaction. Primary sclerosing cholangitis leads to cholestasis. Blockage of the bile duct leads to accumulation of bile, which damages the liver, leading to jaundice and eventually causes liver failure. Signs and symptoms Tiredness (a non-specific symptom often present in liver disease) Severe jaundice with intense itching. Malabsorption (especially of fat) and steatorrhea, leading to decreased levels of the fat-soluble vitamins, A, D, E and K. Signs of cirrhosis Ascending cholangitis? The diagnosis is by imaging of the bile duct, usually in the setting of endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography, which shows characteristic changes (\"beading\") of the bile ducts. Another option is magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (MRCP). The differential diagnosis can include primary biliary cirrhosis, drug induced cholestasis, cholangiocarcinoma, and HIV-associated cholangiopathy. PSC is often listed as a manifestation of ulcerative colitis outside the colon. PSC differs from these manifestations in that, unlike most other manifestations, PSC continues in spite of surgical removal of the colon. Standard treatment includes ursodiol.

Increased levels of CA19-9 are also found in non-malignant conditions, such as Mirizzi's syndrome and diseases of the bile ducts and liver. Guidelines from the American Society of Clinical Oncology discourage the use of CA19-9 as a test for cancer, paicularly pancreatic cancer. The reason is that the test may be falsely normal (false negative) in many cases, or abnormally elevated in people who have no cancer at all (false positive). The main use of CA19-9 is therefore to see whether a pancreatic tumor is secreting it; if that is the case, then the levels should fall when the tumor is treated, and they may rise again if the disease recurs. In patients who lack the Lewis antigen (a blood type protein on red blood cells), which is about 5% of the population, CA19-9 is not elevated in pancreatic cancer even with large tumors because they have a deficiency of a fucosyltransferase enzyme that is needed to produce CA19-9 as well as the Lewis antigen", "cop": 1, "opa": "Pancreatic carcinoma", "opb": "Breast carcinoma", "opc": "Ovarian carcinoma", "opd": "Lung carcinoma", "subject_name": "Pathology", "topic_name": null, "id": "e5f8a19a-5419-4711-949b-8ccbec965a6f", "choice_type": "single", "temporal_label": "None"}

{"question": "Resistance to drugs in tuberculosis develops by: March 2011, March 2013", "exp": "Ans. D: Mutation MDR-TB strains could arise as a consequence of sequential accumulation of mutations conferring resistance to single agents, or by a single step process such as acquisition of an MDR element. Resistance to common anti-TB drugs The most common mechanism of INH resistance is by mutation of the catalas-peroxidase gene so that the bacilli do not generate the active metabolite of 1NH. Rifampicin resistance is nearly always due to mutation in the repoB gene (for the beta subunit of RNA polymerase-the target of rifampin action) reducing its affinity for the drug Resistance to Pyrazinamide develops due to mutation in the pncA gene which encodes for the enzyme generating the active metabolite of pyrazinamide Classification of mutation A. By effect on structure: Small-scale mutations, such as those affecting a small gene in one or a few nucleotides, including: - Point mutations, often caused by chemicals or malfunction of DNA replication, exchange a single nucleotide for another. - These changes are classified as transitions or transversions. - Most common is the transition that exchanges a purine for a purine (A 4-, G) or a pyrimidine for a pyrimidine, (C T). - A transition can be caused by nitrous acid, base mis-pairing, or mutagenic base analogs such as 5-bromo-2 deoxyuridine (BrdU). - Less common is a transversion, which exchanges a purine for a pyrimidine or a pyrimidine for a purine (C/T A/G). - An example of a transversion is adenine (A) being conveed into a cytosine (C). - A point mutation can be reversed by another point mutation, in which the nucleotide is changed back to its original state (true reversion) or by second-site reversion (a complementary mutation elsewhere that results in regained gene functionality). - Point mutations that occur within the protein coding region of a gene may be classified into three kinds, depending upon what the erroneous codon codes for: Silent mutations: which code for the same amino acid. Missense mutations: which code for a different amino acid. Nonsense mutations: which code for a stop and can truncate the protein. - Inseions add one or more extra nucleotides into the DNA. They are usually caused by transposable elements, or errors during replication of repeating elements. - Inseions in the coding region of a gene may alter splicing of the mRNA (splice site mutation), or cause a shift in the reading frame (frameshift), both of which can significantly alter the gene product. - Inseions can be reveed by excision of the transposable element. - Deletions remove one or more nucleotides from the DNA. - Like inseions, these mutations can alter the reading frame of the gene. - They are generally irreversible Note that a deletion is not the exact opposite of an inseion: the former is quite random while the latter consists of a specific sequence inseing at locations that are not entirely random or even quite narrowly defined. Large-scale mutations in chromosomal structure, including: Amplifications (or gene duplications) leading to multiple copies of all chromosomal regions, increasing the dosage of the genes located within them. - Deletions of large chromosomal regions, leading to loss of the genes within those regions. - Mutations whose effect is to juxtapose previously separate pieces of DNA, potentially bringing together separate genes to form functionally distinct fusion genes (e.g. bcr-abl). These include: Chromosomal translocations: Interchange of genetic pas from nonhomologous chromosomes. Interstitial deletions: An intra-chromosomal deletion that removes a segment of DNA from a single chromosome, thereby apposing previously distant genes. For example, cells isolated from a human astrocytoma, a type of brain tumor, were found to have a chromosomal deletion removing sequences between the \"fused in glioblastoma\" (fig) gene and the receptor tyrosine kinase \"ros\", producing a fusion protein (FIG-ROS). The abnormal FIG-ROS fusion protein has constitutively active kinase activity that causes oncogenic transformation (a transformation from normal cells to cancer cells). Chromosomal inversions: Reversing the orientation of a chromosomal segment. - Loss of heterozygosity: Loss of one allele, either by a deletion or recombination event, in an organism that previously had two different alleles. B. By effect on function Loss-of-function mutations are the result of gene product having less or no function. When the allele has a complete loss of function (null allele) it is often called an amorphic mutation. Phenotypes associated with such mutations are most often recessive. Exceptions are when the organism is haploid, or when the reduced dosage of a normal gene product is not enough for a normal phenotype (this is called haploinsufficiency). Gain-of-function mutations change the gene product such that it gains a new and abnormal function. These mutations usually have dominant phenotypes. Often called a neomorphic mutation. Dominant negative mutations (also called antimorphic mutations) have an altered gene product that acts antagonistically to the wild-type allele. These mutations usually result in an altered molecular function (often inactive) and are characterised by a dominant or semi-dominant phenotype. In humans, Marfan syndrome is an example of a dominant negative mutation occurring in an autosomal dominant disease. In this condition, the defective glycoprotein product of the fibrillin gene (FBN1) antagonizes the product of the normal allele. Lethal mutations are mutations that lead to the death of the organisms which carry the mutations. A back mutation or reversion is a point mutation that restores the original sequence and hence the original phenotype. C. By effect on fitness In applied genetics it is usual to speak of mutations as either harmful or beneficial A harmful mutation is a mutation that decreases the fitness of the organism. A beneficial mutation is a mutation that increases fitness of the organism, or which promotes traits that are desirable. In theoretical population genetics, it is more usual to speak of such mutations as deleterious or advantageous. A neutral mutation has no harmful or beneficial effect on the organism. Such mutations occur at a steady rate, forming the basis for the molecular clock. A deleterious mutation has a negative effect on the phenotype, and thus decreases the fitness of the organism. An advantageous mutation has a positive effect on the phenotype, and thus increases the fitness of the organism. A nearly neutral mutation is a mutation that may be slightly deleterious or advantageous, although most nearly neutral mutations are slightly deleterious. D. By pattern of inheritance: The human genome contains two copies of each gene - a paternal and a maternal allele. A heterozygous mutation is a mutation of only one allele. A homozygous mutation is an identical mutation of both the paternal and maternal alleles. Compound heterozygous mutations or a genetic compound comprises two different mutations in the paternal and maternal alleles. A wildtype or homozygous non-mutated organism is one in which neither allele is mutated. (Just not a mutation) E. By impact on protein sequence A frameshift mutation is a mutation caused by inseion or deletion of a number of nucleotides that is not evenly divisible by three from a DNA sequence. Due to the triplet nature of gene expression by codons, the inseion or deletion can disrupt the reading frame, or the grouping of the codons, resulting in a completely different translation from the original. The earlier in the sequence the deletion or inseion occurs, the more altered the protein produced is. In contrast, any inseion or deletion that is evenly divisible by three is termed an in-frame mutation A nonsense mutation is a point mutation in a sequence of DNA that results in a premature stop codon, or a nonsense codon in the transcribed mRNA, and possibly a truncated, and often nonfunctional protein product Missense mutations or nonsynonymous mutations are types of point mutations where a single nucleotide is changed to cause substitution of a different amino acid. This in turn can render the resulting protein nonfunctional. Such mutations are responsible for diseases such as Epidermolysis bullosa, sickle-cell disease. A neutral mutation is a mutation that occurs in an amino acid codon which results in the use of a different, but chemically similar, amino acid. The similarity between the two is enough that little or no change is often rendered in the protein. For example, a change from AAA to AGA will encode arginine, a chemically similar molecule to the intended lysine. Silent mutations are mutations that do not result in a change to the amino acid sequence of a protein. They may occur in a region that does not code for a protein, or they may occur within a codon in a manner that does not alter the final amino acid sequence. The phrase silent mutation is often used interchangeably with the phrase synonymous mutation; however, synonymous mutations are a subcategory of the former, occurring only within exons. The name silent could be a misnomer. For example, a silent mutation in the exon/intron border may lead to alternative splicing by changing the splice site, thereby leading to a changed protein. Silent mutations occur because of the degenerate nature of the genetic code. F. Special classes Conditional mutation is a mutation that has wild-type (or less severe) phenotype under ceain \"permissive\" environmental conditions and a mutant phenotype under ceain \"restrictive\" conditions. For example, a temperature-sensitive mutation can cause cell death at high temperature (restrictive condition), but might have no deleterious consequences at a lower temperature (permissive condition).", "cop": 4, "opa": "Transduction", "opb": "Conjugation", "opc": "Transformation", "opd": "Mutation", "subject_name": "Pharmacology", "topic_name": null, "id": "34601410-63af-4fd3-8dfd-9060caa153ae", "choice_type": "single", "temporal_label": "None"}

C: Sliding herniaIndirect inguinal herniaAn indirect inguinal hernia follows the tract through the inguinal canal. This results from a persistent process vaginalis. The inguinal canal begins in the intra-abdominal cavity at the internal inguinal ring, located approximately midway between the pubic symphysis and the anterior iliac spine.The canal courses down along the inguinal ligament to the external ring, located medial to the inferior epigastric aeries, subcutaneously and slightly above the pubic tubercle.Contents of this hernia then follow the tract of the testicle down into the scrotal sac.Direct herniaA direct inguinal hernia usually occurs due to a defect or weakness in the transversalis fascia area of the Hesselbach triangle.The triangle is defined inferiorly by the inguinal ligament, laterally by the inferior epigastric aeries, and medially by the conjoined tendon.Femoral herniaThe femoral hernia follows the tract below the inguinal ligament through the femoral canal. The canal lies medial to the femoral vein and lateral to the lacunar (Gimbernat) ligament.Because femoral hernias protrude through such a small defined space, they frequently become incarcerated or strangulated.Umbilical herniaThe umbilical hernia occurs through the umbilical fibromuscular ring, which usually obliterates by 2 years of age. They are congenital in origin and are repaired if they persist in children older than age 2-4 years.Richter herniaThe Richter hernia occurs when only the antimesenteric border of the bowel herniates through the fascial defect. The Richter hernia involves only a poion of the circumference of the bowel.As such, the bowel may not be obstructed, even if the hernia is incarcerated or strangulated, and the patient may not present with vomiting.The Richter hernia can occur with any of the various abdominal hernias and is paicularly dangerous, as a poion of strangulated bowel may be reduced unknowingly into the abdominal cavity, leading to perforation and peritonitis Incisional herniaThis iatrogenic hernia occurs in 2-10% of all abdominal operations secondary to breakdown of the fascial closure of prior surgery. Even after repair, recurrence rates approach 20-45%.Spigelian herniaThis rare form of abdominal wall hernia occurs through a defect in the spigelian fascia, which is defined by the lateral edge of the rectus muscle at the arcuate line (costal arch to the pubic tubercle).Obturator herniaThis hernia passes through the obturator foramen, following the path of the obturator nerves and muscles. Obturator hernias occur with a female-to-male ratio of 6:1, because of a gender-specific larger canal diameter.Because of its anatomic position, this hernia presents more commonly as a bowel obstruction than as a protrusion of bowel contentsSliding herniaAs a result of slipping of the posterior parietal peritoneum on the underlying retroperitoneal structures, the posterior wall of the sac is not formed of peritoneum alone, but by the sigmoid colon and its mesentery on the left, the caecum on the right and, sometimes on either side by a poion of the bladder.", "cop": 3, "opa": "Richter's hernia", "opb": "Spigelian hernia", "opc": "Sliding hernia", "opd": "Interstitial hernia", "subject_name": "Surgery", "topic_name": null, "id": "4bc27174-cf5b-4413-aad9-da908fb3e650", "choice_type": "multi", "temporal_label": "None"}

{"question": "Drug of choice in paracetamol overdose: March 2011", "exp": "Ans. A: N-acetyl cysteine In paracetamol poisoning, depletion of hepatic and renal glutathione potentiates the toxicity whereas treatment with sulfhydryl compounds such as cysteamine, 1- methionine and N-acetyl cysteine (NAC) is beneficial Acetylcysteine/ N-acetylcysteine/ N-acetyl-L-cysteine/ NAC) It is used primarily as a mucolytic agent and in the management of paracetamol (acetaminophen) overdose. Other uses include sulfate repletion in conditions, such as autism, where cysteine and related sulfur amino acids may be depleted. Acetylcysteine is a derivative of cysteine; an acetyl group is attached to the nitrogen atom. It is used as a cough medicine because it breaks disulfide bonds in mucus and liquefies it, making it easier to cough up. It is also this action of breaking disulfide bonds that makes it useful in thinning the abnormally thick mucus in Cystic Fibrosis patients Intravenous acetylcysteine is indicated for the treatment of paracetamol (acetaminophen) overdose. When paracetamol is taken in large quantities, a minor metabolite called N-acetyl- p-benzoquinone imine (NAPQI ) accumulates within the body. It is normally conjugated by glutathione, but when taken in excess, the body's glutathione reserves are not sufficient to inactivate the toxic NAPQI. This metabolite is then free to react with key hepatic enzymes, therefore damaging hepatocytes. This may lead to severe liver damage and even death by fulminant liver failure. For this indication, acetylcysteine acts to augment the glutathione reserves in the body and, together with glutathione, directly bind to toxic metabolites. These actions serve to protect hepatocytes in the liver from NAPQI toxicity. Although both IV and oral acetylcysteine are equally effective for this indication, oral administration is poorly tolerated because high oral doses are required due to low oral bioavailability, because of its very unpleasant taste and odour, and because of adverse effects, paicularly nausea and vomiting.

Hence a properly functioning brain stem is a precondition for full consciousness.

{"question": "Iron is transpoed bound to: September 2011", "exp": "Ans. B: Transferrin Transferrin/siderophilin binds the iron in the lumen of GIT and most of the iron is transpoed bound to this globulin across the mucosal brush border Transferrin They are iron-binding blood plasma glycoproteins that control the level of free iron in biological fluids. In humans, it is encoded by the TF gene. Transferrin is a glycoprotein that binds iron very tightly but reversibly. Although iron bound to transferrin is less than 0.1% (4 mg) of the total body iron, it is the most impoant iron pool, with the highest rate of turnover. Transferrin has a molecular weight of around 80 kDa and contains 2 specific high-affinity Fe (III) binding sites. The affinity of transferrin for Fe (III) is extremely high but decreases progressively with decreasing pH below neutrality. When not bound to iron, it is known as \"apo-transferrin\" Ferritin It is a ubiquitous intracellular protein that stores iron and releases it in a controlled fashion. The amount of ferritin stored reflects the amount of iron stored. In humans, it acts as a buffer against iron deficiency and iron overload. Ferritin is a globular protein complex consisting of 24 protein subunits and is the primary intracellular iron-storage protein in both prokaryotes and eukaryotes, keeping iron in a soluble and non-toxic form.

Plasmin aids healing by removing excess fibrin. This aids the migration of keratinocytes into the wound to restore the epithelium under the scab. Collagen proliferates, producing the scar.

Respiratory splitting of the second sound immediately returns to normal following surgical repair of an atrial septa] defect, although the pulmonic closure sound may remain delayed for weeks or months.Severe right hea failure can lead to a relatively fixed split. This occurs because the right ventricle fails to respond to the increased volume produced by inspiration and because the lungs are so congested that impedance to forward flow from the right ventricle barely falls during inspiration.In anomalous pulmonary venous return without atrial septal defect, fixed splitting is not usually seen despite the simultaneous inspiratory delay in aoic and pulmonic closure", "cop": 3, "opa": "Normal individuals", "opb": "Left bundle branch block", "opc": "ASD", "opd": "VSD", "subject_name": "Medicine", "topic_name": null, "id": "55bc3bbe-108a-4b81-9bae-9d5774f660dc", "choice_type": "single", "temporal_label": "None"}

Illusions or hallucinations of the deceased person are common. The uncomplicated grief reaction can last several months, or longer, depending on the relationship to the deceased. Depression secondary to a general medical condition can be seen in association with cardiopulmonary disease, among other disorders; however, since the symptoms are related to the precipitating event, one would have to wait till the normal grief is resolved and then reassess the presence of symptoms of depression.

The symptoms of schizophrenia may be divided into the following 4 domains: Positive symptoms: These include psychotic symptoms, such as hallucinations, which are usually auditory; delusions; and disorganized speech and behavior. Negative symptoms: These include a decrease in emotional range, povey of speech, loss of interests, and loss of drive. Cognitive symptoms: These include neurocognitive deficits, such as deficits in working memory and attention and executive functions such as the ability to organize and abstract. Mood symptoms: Schizophrenia patients often seem cheerful or sad in a way that does not make sense to others. They often are depressed. Catatonia Schizophrenia This syndrome occurs in children, adolescents, and adults; is associated with a heterogeneous group of comorbid conditions; and is characterized by a variety of symptoms and signs of impairment of the expression of voluntary thoughts and movements.

{"question": "Which of the following is an enrichment media: September 2009", "exp": "Ans. D: All of the above Culture media may be classified into several categories depending on their composition or use. A chemically-defined (synthetic) medium is one in which the exact chemical composition is known. A complex (undefined) medium is one in which the exact chemical constitution of the medium is not known. Defined media are usually composed of pure biochemicals off the shelf; complex media usually contain complex materials of biological origin such as blood or milk or yeast extract or beef extract, the exact chemical composition of which is obviously undetermined. A defined medium is a minimal medium if it provides. only the exact nutrients (including any growth factors) needed by the organism for growth. A selective medium is one which has a component(s) added to it which will inhibit or prevent the growth of ceain types or species of bacteria and/or promote the growth of desired species. A culture medium may also be a differential medium if allows to distinguish between different types of bacteria based on some observable trait in their pattern of growth on the medium. Thus a selective, differential medium for the isolation of Staphylococcus aureus, contains a very high concentration of salt (which the staph will tolerate) that inhibits most other bacteria, mannitol as a source of fermentable sugar, and a pH indicator dye. From clinical specimens, only staph will grow. S. aureus is differentiated from S. epidermidis (a nonpathogenic component of the normal flora) on the basis of its ability to ferment mannitol. Mannitol-fermenting colonies (S. aureus) produce acid which reacts with the indicator dye forming a colored halo around the colonies; mannitol non-fermenters (S. epidermidis) use other non-fermentative substrates in the medium for growth and do not form a halo around their colonies. MacConkey's medium shows up lactose fermenters as pink colonies An enrichment medium contains some component that permits the growth of specific types or species of bacteria, usually because they alone can utilize the component from their environment.

Hemoglobin is 10.3 g/dL, MCV is 80 fL, serum iron is 28 mg/dL, iron-binding capacity is 200 mg/dL (normal 250-370 mg/dL), and saturation is 14%. Which of the following is the most likely explanation for this woman's anemia?", "exp": "Patients with chronic inflammatory or neoplastic disease often develop anemia of chronic disease. Cytokines produced by inflammation cause a block in the normal recirculation of iron from reticuloendothelial cells (which pick up the iron from senescent red blood cells) to the red cell precursors (normoblasts). The peptide hepcidin is felt to be the main mediator of the effect. This defect in iron reutilization causes a drop in the serum iron concentration and a normocytic or mildly microcytic anemia. The inflammatory reaction, however, also decreases the iron-binding capacity (as opposed to iron-deficiency anemia, where the iron-binding capacity is elevated), so the saturation is usually between 10% and 20%. The anemia is rarely severe (Hgbrarely<8.5g/dL). The hemoglobin and hematocrit will improve if the underlying process is treated. Diseases not associated with inflammation or neoplasia (i.e., diabetes, hypertension, etc.) do not cause anemia of chronic disease. Blood loss causes a lower serum iron level, an elevated iron-binding capacity, and a lower iron saturation. The serum ferritin (low in iron deficiency, normal or high in anemia of chronic disease) will usually clarify this situation. Vitamin B12 and folate deficiencies are associated with macrocytic anemia. Sideroblastic anemia can be either microcytic or macrocytic (occasionally with a dimorphic population of cells, some small and some large), but is associated with an elevated iron level. In addition, this patient's history (which suggests an inflammatory polyarthritis) would not be consistent with sideroblastic anemia.

Erythropoietin can also be extracted from the spleen and salivary glands, but these tissues do not contain the mRNA and consequently do not appear to manufacture the hormone.When renal mass is reduced in adults by renal disease or nephrectomy, the liver cannot compensate and anemia develops. Erythropoietin is produced by interstitial cells in the peritubular capillary bed of the kidneys and by perivenous hepatocytes in the liver. It is also produced in the brain, where it exes a protective effect against excitotoxic damage triggered by hypoxia; and in the uterus and oviducts, where it is induced by estrogen and appears to mediate estrogen-dependent angiogenesis.", "cop": 1, "opa": "Interstitial cells of kidney", "opb": "Extraglomerular mesangial cells", "opc": "Macula densa", "opd": "Renal tubular epithelial cells", "subject_name": "Physiology", "topic_name": null, "id": "8d9c5947-0e9b-4bbe-89c6-8a06370cf06b", "choice_type": "single", "temporal_label": "None"}
{"question": "Oculocardiac reflex is seen in which surgery: March 2007", "exp": "Ans. B: Strabismus surgery The oculocardiac reflex/ Aschner phenomenon,/ Aschner reflex/ Aschner-Dagnini reflex, is a decrease in pulse rate associated with traction applied to extraocular muscles and/or compression of the eyeball. The reflex is mediated by nerve connections between the trigeminal cranial nerve and the vagus nerve of the parasympathetic nervous system. The afferent tracts derive mainly from the ophthalmic division of the trigeminal nerve. These afferents synapse with the visceral motor nucleus of the vagus nerve, located in the reticular formation of the brain stem. The efferent poion is carried by the vagus nerve from the cardiovascular center of the medulla to the hea, of which increased stimulation leads to decreased output of the sinoatrial node. This reflex is especially sensitive in neonates and children, and must be monitored, usually by an anaesthesiologist, during paediatric ophthalmological surgery, paicularly during strabismus correction surgery. However, this reflex may also occur with adults. Bradycardia, junctional rhythm, asystole, and very rarely death, can be induced through this reflex.", "cop": 2, "opa": "Cataract surgery", "opb": "Strabismus surgery", "opc": "Ventricular Septemberal Defect surgery", "opd": "Valvular surgery", "subject_name": "Ophthalmology", "topic_name": null, "id": "2cfad452-10db-4b89-808f-d1073c196d8a", "choice_type": "single", "temporal_label": "None"}
{"question": "Maintenance of anaesthesia in 70 yr male for surgery duration 4-6 hrs should ideally include?", "exp": "ANSWER: (D) O2 + Air + Desflurane + Atracurium + RemifentanylREF: Miller's Anaesthesiology 7th Ed Ch 71 Table 71-7, Ch 28, Stoelting s Anesthesia and Co- Existing Disease, 5th ed. Ch 25The most important information in the above question is that the patient is 70 yrs old, i.e, of a geriatric age. Geriatric patients have a lot of anaesthetic implications. As a rule, we must consider shorter acting agents in these patients.Our body can be considered to be divided into 3 compartments when we inject any drug. These compartments are formed on the basis of the speed with which the drug reaches various parts of the body.Three-compartment model (including the biophase) schematizing the basic pharmacokinetic processes that occur after intravenous drug administration.I = dosing scheme as a function of timekl0 = Rate constant reflecting all processes acting to irreversibly remove drug from the central compartmentVI = central compartment volume, usually expressed in liters or liters per kilogram.Central compartment-blood, highly vascular tissues like brain - The effect of Anaesthetic drugs primarily depends on the duration of drug in central compartment & volume of the compartment since they primarily act on CNSIntermediate compartment-intermediate blood supply organs like skeletal musclesPeripheral compartment-adipose tissue - responsible for storage & delayed release of drugs into circulationGeriatric patients have an increased fat mass and decreased muscle mass. Also, they are dehydrated leading to contraction of the central compartment. Thus, more drug is present in the central compartment on immediate injection (causing a profound effect at a normal dose), & more fat is available for delayed release of drugs back into the circulation, leading to prolonged action of drugs (see figure)They may have a decreased renal & hepatic clearanceDecreased cardiac output may contribute to a slow onset of drug effects followed by prolonged action secondary to delayed clearance (i.e.f barbiturates, benzodiazepines).Minimal alveolar concentration of inhalation anesthetics decreases with age (6% for each decade after age 40), which parallels loss of neurons and decreased cerebral metabolism.Short-acting intravenous drugs and volatile anesthetics with lower partition coefficients provide the advantage of more rapid elimination, brisk emergence, and reorientation to the patient's surroundings, and potentially lower incidence of confusion and delirium during recovery. However, the recovery of cognitive function, measured by the Mini-Mental State Examination, has not been shown to be different between various agents.Desflurane is associated with the most rapid emergence. (It has a low solubility hence faster onset & shorter time for emergence)A more predictable method of opioid titration may be to use a shorter acting opioid such as remifentanil. By adjusting the bolus and infusion doses, the variability in remifentanil pharmacokinetics is considerably less than for other intravenous opioids. (Morphine has a much longer duration of action)Similarly, it may be prudent to use shorter acting muscle relaxants. Studies show that there is an increased incidence of postoperative residual block and pulmonary complications in patients receiving pancuronium compared with atracurium or vecuronium. Atracurium depends to a small extent on hepatic metabolism and excretion, and elimination half-life is prolonged in elderly patients. Clearance is unchanged with age, however, suggesting that alternative pathways of elimination (ester hydrolysis and Hofmann elimination) assume importance in elderly patients.CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY OF ANESTHETIC AGENTS IN ELDERLY PATIENTSDrugBrain SensitivityPharmacokineticsDoseinhaled agents|--|Thiopental--|Initial distribution volume|Etomidate--|Initial distribution volume| |Clearance Propofol||Clearance|Midazolam||Clearance|Morphine||Clearance|Sufentanil|--|Alfentanil| |Fentanyl| |Remifentanil||Clearance-- |Central compartment volume|PancuroniumNA|Clearance|AtracuriumNA----CisatracuriumNA----VecuroniumNA|Clearance|", "cop": 4, "opa": "O2+Air + Isoflurane + Pancuronium + Morphine", "opb": "O2+Air + Sevoflurane + Pancuronium + Remifentanyl", "opc": "O2+Air + Halothane + Vecuronium + Morphine", "opd": "O2+Air + Desflurane + Atracurium + Remifentanyl", "subject_name": "Anaesthesia", "topic_name": "Geriatric Anesthesia", "id": "fd5bc635-0ba0-4c45-9c44-5c6125dd0752", "choice_type": "multi", "temporal_label": "None"}
{"question": "Which of the following decreases intestinal motility: March 2011", "exp": "Ans. D: Secretin The strength of the contractions of small intestine is propoional to the frequency of the spike generated by the slow waves \"Slow wave\" amplitude is increased by GIT hormones released during digestion e.g. gastrin, CCK-PZ and motilin; whereas secretin and glucagons decrease the slow wave amplitude Intestinal motility Digestive hormones, cholecystokinin (CCK), gastrin and motilin increase intestinal motility Secretin decreases the activity. Serotonin and insulin can increase motility Glucagon can decrease motility. Secretin Secretin is synthesized in cytoplasmic secretory granules of S-cells which are found mainly in mucosa of duodenum and smaller numbers in jejunum of small intestine Secretin is released into circulation and/or intestinal lumen in response to low duodenal pH. Also the secretion of secretin is increased by the products of protein digestion bathing the mucosa of the upper small intestine. It is the active form of prosecretin. This acidity is due to hydrochloric acid in the chyme that enters the duodenum from the stomach the pyloric sphincter. Secretin targets the pancreas, which causes the organ to secrete a bicarbonate-rich fluid that flows into the intestine. Bicarbonate ion is a base that neutralizes the acid, thus establishing a pH orable to the action of other digestive enzymes in the small intestine and preventing acid burns. Other factors are also involved in the release of secretin such as bile salts and fatty acids, which result in additional bicarbonates being added to the small intestine. Secretin release is inhibited by H2 receptor antagonists, which reduce gastric acid secretion. As a result, if the pH in the duodenum increases above 4.5, secretin cannot be released Secretin increases water and bicarbonate secretion from duodenal Brunner's glands in order to buffer the incoming protons of the acidic chyme. It also enhances the effects of cholecystokinin to induce the secretion of digestive enzymes and bile from pancreas and gallbladder, respectively. It counteracts blood glucose concentration spikes by triggering increased insulin release from pancreas, following oral glucose intake. Although secretin releases gastrin from gastrinomas, it inhibits gastrin release from the normal stomach. It reduces acid secretion from the stomach by inhibiting gastrin release from G cells. In addition, secretin stimulates pepsin secretion from chief cells", "cop": 4, "opa": "CCK", "opb": "Serotonin", "opc": "Gastrin", "opd": "Secretin", "subject_name": "Physiology", "topic_name": null, "id": "54fb78a8-fd33-4cb1-9fe0-ba3d7e0a6eb2", "choice_type": "single", "temporal_label": "None"}

The condition can be treated with -", "exp": "Skeletal fluorosis is a bone disease caused by excessive accumulation of fluoride in the bones. In advanced cases, skeletal fluorosis causes painful damage to bones and joints. Symptoms are mainly promoted in the bone structure. Due to a high fluoride concentration in the body, the bone is hardened and thus less elastic, resulting in an increased frequency of fractures. Other symptoms include thickening of the bone structure and accumulation of bone tissue, which both contribute to impaired joint mobility. Ligaments and cailage can become ossified.Most patients suffering from skeletal fluorosis show side effects from the high fluoride dose such as ruptures of the stomach lining and nausea. Fluoride can also damage the parathyroid glands, leading to hyperparathyroidism, the uncontrolled secretion of parathyroid hormones. These hormones regulate calcium concentration in the body. An elevated parathyroid hormone concentration results in a depletion of calcium in bone structures and thus a higher calcium concentration in the blood. As a result, bone flexibility decreases making the bone more susceptible to fractures As of now, there are no established treatments for skeletal fluorosis patients.However, it is reversible in some cases, depending on the progression of the disease. If fluorine intake is stopped, the amount in bone will decrease and be excreted urine. However, it is a very slow process to eliminate the fluorine from the body completely. Minimal results are seen in patients. Treatment of side effects is also very difficult. For example, a patient with a bone fracture cannot be treated according to standard procedures, because the bone is very brittle. In this case, recovery will take a very long time and a pristine healing cannot be guaranteed. However, fuher fluorosis can be prevented by drinking defluoridated water. It is recently suggested that drinking of defluoridated water from the ''calcium amended-hydroxyapatite'' defluoridation method may help in the fluorosis reversal.Defluoridated water from this suggested method provides calcium-enriched alkaline drinking water as generally fluoride contaminated water has a low amount of calcium mineral and drinking alkaline water helps in eliminating the toxic fluoride from the body Ref Davidson 23rd edition pg 716", "cop": 2, "opa": "Supplementationof vitamin D", "opb": "Change in source of water", "opc": "Good-balanced diet", "opd": "Calcium chelation", "subject_name": "Medicine", "topic_name": "Miscellaneous", "id": "5563edb5-3897-445e-8740-6cf0e0174504", "choice_type": "multi", "temporal_label": "Chronic"}

TSH and cortisol levels are normal.", "exp": "Syndrome of inappropriate of antidiuretic hormone (SIADH) is a disorder of impaired water excretion due to excessive secretion of ADH hormone, often by neoplastic cells. Antidiuretic hormone makes the urine concentrated, thereby preventing free water excretion. This leads to water retention and hyponatremia. As total body water increases, the serum osmolality decreases. In normal person, when serum osmolality decreases, the kidneys produce dilute urine to excrete excess water. In SIADH, however, continued ADH release from the tumor prevents urinary dilution, and urine osmolality remains inappropriately high. Urine osmolality more than 100 mOsm/kg in face of hyponatremia is highly suspicious of SIADH. Urine Na value is also higher than 40 mEq/L in SIADH. It is most commonly seen in small cell cancer of the lung.Tumor lysis syndrome (TLS) is an oncologic emergency resulting from breakdown of tumor cells with subsequent release of potassium, phosphate, and uric acid into the circulation.

B: 10 days For measles, time period from exposure and development of first symptom (onset of fever) is 10 days Measles/ Rubedegla/ Morbilli It is an infection of the respiratory system caused by a virus, specifically a paramyxovirus of the genus Morbillivirus. Morbilliviruses, like other paramyxoviruses, are enveloped, single-stranded, negative-sense RNA viruses. Symptoms include fever, cough, runny nose, red eyes and a generalized, maculopapular, erythematous rash. Measles (also sometimes known as English Measles) is spread through respiration (contact with fluids from an infected person's nose and mouth, either directly or through aerosol transmission), and is highly contagious -- 90% of people without immunity sharing living space with an infected person will catch it. An asymptomatic incubation period occurs nine to twelve days from initial exposure and infectivity lasts from two to four days prior, until two to five days following the onset of the rash (i.e. four to nine days infectivity in total). An alternative name for measles in English-speaking countries is rubeola, which is sometimes confused with rubella (German measles); the diseases are unrelated The classical symptoms of measles include four-day fevers and the three Cs -- cough, coryza (head cold) and conjunctivitis (red eyes). The fever may reach up to 40 degC (104 degF). Koplik's spots seen inside the mouth are pathognomonic (diagnostic) for measles, but are not often seen, even in real cases of measles, because they are transient and may disappear within a day of arising.

A: Sacral poion of spinal cordThe smooth muscle of the bladder (detrusor) is innervated by sympathetic nervous system fibers (from the lumbar spinal cord) and parasympathetic fibers (from the sacral spinal cord).Fibers in the pelvic nerves are the afferent limb of the voiding reflex, and the parasympathetic fibers to the bladder that constitutes the efferent limb also travel in these nerves.The reflex is integrated in the sacral poion of the spinal cord.Muscle bundles pass on either side of the urethra called the internal urethral sphincter.Faher along the urethra is a sphincter of skeletal muscle called external urethral sphincter.When the individual is ready to urinate, he or she consciously initiates voiding, causing the bladder to contract and the outlet to relax.During the storage phase the internal urethral sphincter remains tense and the detrusor muscle relaxed by sympathetic stimulation.During micturition, parasympathetic stimulation causes the detrusor muscle to contract and the internal urethral sphincter to relax. The external urethral sphincter (sphincter urethrae) is under somatic control and is consciously relaxed during micturition.Once the voluntary signal to begin voiding has been issued, neurons in pontine micturition center fire maximally, causing excitation of sacral preganglionic neurons. The firing of these neurons causes the wall of the bladder to contract; as a result, a sudden, sharp rise in pressure in intravesical pressure occurs.When the external urinary sphincter is relaxed urine flows from the urinary bladder when the pressure there is great enough to force urine to flow through the urethra.When the sacral dorsal roots are interrupted by diseases of the dorsal roots such as tabes dorsalis in humans, all reflex contractions of the bladder are abolished. The bladder becomes distended, thin-walled, and hypotonic. When the afferent and efferent nerves are both destroyed, as they may be by tumors of the cauda equina or filum terminale, the bladder is flaccid and distended for a while. Gradually, however, the muscle of the \"decentralized bladder\" becomes active. The bladder becomes shrunken and the bladder wall hyperophied.During spinal shock, the bladder is flaccid and unresponsive. It becomes overfilled, and urine dribbles through the sphincters (overflow incontinence).After spinal shock has passed, the voiding reflex returns, although there is, of course, no voluntary control and no inhibition or facilitation from higher centers when the spinal cord is transected. Bladder capacity is reduced, and the wall becomes hyperophied. This type of bladder is sometimes called the spastic neurogenic bladder.", "cop": 1, "opa": "Sacral poion of spinal cord", "opb": "Lumbar poion of spinal cord", "opc": "Substantia gelatinosa", "opd": "Sympathetic plexus", "subject_name": "Physiology", "topic_name": null, "id": "52e93bc6-8a58-4f66-ac21-cc5f7ca4de3c", "choice_type": "single", "temporal_label": "None"}

At the same time, the separation of the jaws alters the vertical equilibrium on the posterior teeth, and as a result, there is more eruption of posterior teeth than might otherwise have occurred.

{"question": "Not a risk factor of rhegmatogenous retinal detachment: March 2011", "exp": "Ans. C: Diabetes Secondatv retinal detachment may be due to the retina being mechanically pulled away from its bed by the contraction of fibrous tissue in the vitreous, tractional detachment, such as occurs in plastic cyclitis, proliferative retinopathy (diabetes) or the retinopathy of the prematurity Predisposing factors for rhegmatogenous detachment (commonest type) of the retina are myopia, previous intraocular surgery such as aphakia or pseudophakia, a family history of retinal detachment, trauma and inflammation Retinal detachment It is a disorder of the eye in which the retina peels away from its underlying layer of suppo tissue. Initial detachment may be localized, but without rapid treatment the entire retina may detach, leading to vision loss and blindness. It is a medical emergency. Types 1. Rhegmatogenous retinal detachment A rhegmatogenous retinal detachment occurs due to a break in the retina that allows fluid to pass from the vitreous space into the subretinal space between the sensory retina and the retinal pigment epithelium. Retinal breaks are divided into three types - holes, tears and dialyses. Holes form due to retinal atrophy especially within an area of lattice degeneration. Tears are due to vitreoretinal traction. Dialyses which are very peripheral and circumferential may be either tractional or atrophic, the atrophic form most often occurring as idiopathic dialysis of the young. 2. Exudative, serous, or secondary retinal detachment An exudative retinal detachment occurs due to inflammation, injury or vascular abnormalities that results in fluid accumulating underneath the retina without the presence of a hole, tear, or break. In evaluation of retinal detachment it is critical to exclude exudative detachment as surgery will make the situation worse, not better. Although rare, exudative retinal detachment can be caused by the growth of a tumor on the layers of tissue beneath the retina, namely the choroid. This cancer is called a choroidal melanoma. 3. Tractional retinal detachment A tractional retinal detachment occurs when fibrous or fibrovascular tissue, caused by an injury, inflammation or neovascularization, pulls the sensory retina from the retinal pigment epithelium. Tractional retinal detachments can also occur in patients with proliferative diabetic retinopathy or those with proliferative retinopathy of sickle cell disease. In proliferative retinopathy, abnormal blood vessels (neovascularization) grow within the retina and extend into the vitreous. In advanced disease, the vessels can pull the retina away from the back wall of the eye, leading to tractional retinal detachment. A minority of retinal detachments result from trauma, including blunt blows to the orbit, penetrating trauma, and concussions to the head. Frequency The incidence of retinal detachment in otherwise normal eyes is around 5 new cases in 100,000 persons per year. Retinal detachment is more common in people with severe myopia (above 5-6 diopters), in whom the retina is more thinly stretched. About two-thirds of cases of retinal detachment occur in myopics. Retinal detachment is more frequent after surgery for cataracts. Although retinal detachment usually occurs in just one eye, there is a 15% chance of it developing in the other eye, and this risk increases to 30-35% in patients who have had cataracts extracted from both eyes", "cop": 3, "opa": "Aphakia", "opb": "High myopia", "opc": "Diabetes", "opd": "Pseudophakia", "subject_name": "Ophthalmology", "topic_name": null, "id": "c3a0701d-fdb8-4800-9b92-abe5a94d77a2", "choice_type": "single", "temporal_label": "None"}
{"question": "Wilson disease is due to accumulation of: September 2005", "exp": "Ans. A: Copper In Wilson disease, main sites of copper accumulation are the liver and the brain, and consequently liver disease and neuropsychiatric symptoms are the main features that lead to diagnosis. Liver disease may present as tiredness, increased bleeding tendency or confusion (due to hepatic encephalopathy) and poal hypeension. On examination, signs of chronic liver disease such as spider naevi (small distended blood vessels, usually on the chest) may be observed. Chronic active hepatitis has caused cirrhosis of the liver in most patients by the time they develop symptoms. About 5% of all patients are diagnosed only when they develop fulminant acute liver failure, often in the context of a hemolytic anemia. About half the patients with Wilson's have neurological or psychiatric problems. Specific neurological symptoms then follow, often in the form of parkinsonism (increased rigidity and slowing of routine movements) with or without a typical hand tremor, masked facial expressions, slurred speech, ataxia (lack of coordination) or dystonia (twisting and repetitive movements of pa of the body). Various medical conditions have been linked with copper accumulation in Wilson's disease: Eyes: Kayser-Fleischer rings (KF rings) may be visible around the iris. They are due to copper deposition in Descemet's membrane of the cornea. They do not occur in all patients and may only be visible on slit lamp examination. Wilson's disease is also associated with sunflower cataracts, brown or green pigmentation of the anterior and posterior lens capsule. Kidneys: renal tubular acidosis, a disorder of bicarbonate handling by the PCT leads to nephrocalcinosis (calcium accumulation in the kidneys), weakening of the bone (due to calcium and phosphate loss) and occasionally aminoaciduria.

Several mechanisms of increased vascular permeability have been proposed, including formation of interendothelial gaps by contraction of endothelium. This contraction can be caused by mediators such as histamine and leukotrienes. The vessels then become more \"leaky,\" and the fluid leaves the intravascular space to accumulate extravascularly, forming effusions in body cavities or edema within tissues. Arteriolar vasoconstriction is a transient response to injury that helps diminish blood loss. Platelets adhere to damaged endothelium and promote hemostasis. Lymphatic obstruction results in the accumulation of protein-rich lymph and lymphocytes, producing a chylous effusion within a body cavity.

Radiography ofthe forearm revealed interosseous membrane calcification and radiography ofthe spine revealed a rugger-jersey appearance (striated pattern of increased density in the upper and lower zones of the veebrae). The probable diagnosis is", "exp": "Skeletal fluorosis is a bone disease caused by excessive accumulation of fluoride in the bones. In advanced cases, skeletal fluorosis causes painful damage to bones and joints. Symptoms are mainly promoted in the bone structure. Due to a high fluoride concentration in the body, the bone is hardened and thus less elastic, resulting in an increased frequency of fractures. Other symptoms include thickening of the bone structure and accumulation of bone tissue, which both contribute to impaired joint mobility. Ligaments and cailage can become ossified. Most patients suffering from skeletal fluorosis show side effects from the high fluoride dose such as ruptures of the stomach lining and nausea. Fluoride can also damage the parathyroid glands, leading to hyperparathyroidism, the uncontrolled secretion of parathyroid hormones. These hormones regulate calcium concentration in the body. An elevated parathyroid hormone concentration results in a depletion of calcium in bone structures and thus a higher calcium concentration in the blood. As a result, bone flexibility decreases making the bone more susceptible to fractures Mechanism of action The best way to view the mechanism of action by which fluorine breaks down bones and causes skeletal fluorosis is in a stepwise fashion. Fluoride enters the body by two paths: Ingestion or respiration. Both paths lead to corrosion of exposed tissue in high concentrations. Since the most likely form of fluoride to enter the body is hydrogen fluoride (HF) gas, this is what stas the process. Exposed tissues will be utilized by HF in neutralization reactions. This will leave F- free to pass fuher into the body. It reacts with the concentrated HCl in the stomach to form the weak acid, HF. This compound is then absorbed by the gastro-intestinal tract and passes into the liver the poal vein. Since elemental F is one of the strongest oxidizers currently known, the anion F- is immune to phase 1 metabolic reactions, which are generally oxidation reactions, in the liver. These reactions are the body's first line of defense to biotransform harmful compounds into something more hydrophilic and more easily excreted. The HF is now free to pass into the blood stream and be distributed to all tissues including bones. Bones are largely composed of Ca compounds, paicularly carbonated hydroxyapatite (Ca 5(PO 4) 3(OH)); the reaction of Ca2+ ions and HF forms an insoluble salt, CaF 2. This salt must be cleared by the body, which concomitantly leaches out some of the calcium that would be pa of the bone matrix. This process results in increased density, but decreased strength in bones As of now, there are no established treatments for skeletal fluorosis patients. However, it is reversible in some cases, depending on the progression of the disease. If fluorine intake is stopped, the amount in bone will decrease and be excreted urine. However, it is a very slow process to eliminate the fluorine from the body completely. Minimal results are seen in patients. Treatment of side effects is also very difficult. For example, a patient with a bone fracture cannot be treated according to standard procedures, because the bone is very brittle. In this case, recovery will take a very long time and a pristine healing cannot be guaranteed. However, fuher fluorosis can be prevented by drinking defluoridated water. It is recently suggested that drinking of defluoridated water from the ''calcium amended-hydroxyapatite'' defluoridation method may help in the fluorosis reversal. Defluoridated water from this suggested method provides calcium-enriched alkaline drinking water as generally fluoride contaminated water has a low amount of calcium mineral and drinking alkaline water helps in eliminating the toxic fluoride from the body Ref Davidson 23rd edition pg 715", "cop": 2, "opa": "Silicosis", "opb": "Fluorosis", "opc": "Vitamin B toxicity", "opd": "Hypercalcinosis", "subject_name": "Medicine", "topic_name": "Miscellaneous", "id": "1e2a890b-0caf-4055-89fe-e0125e1a9958", "choice_type": "multi", "temporal_label": "Chronic"}

{"question": "Parameter which should be tested before staing heparin therapy: September 2011", "exp": "Ans. D: Activated paial thromboplastin time Monitoring of heparin therapy is done by either whole blood clotting time (kept 2-3 times the normal) or activated paial thromboplastin time (kept upto 1.5-2 times the normal) Paial thromboplastin time/ PTT/ activated paial thromboplastin time (aPTT/ APTT It is a performance indicator measuring the efficacy of both the \"intrinsic\" (now referred to as the contact activation pathway) and the common coagulation pathways. Apa from detecting abnormalities in blood clotting, it is also used to monitor the treatment effects with heparin, a major anticoagulant. It is used in conjunction with the prothrombin time (PT) which measures the extrinsic pathway. Kaolin cephalin clotting time (KccT) is a historic name for the activated paial thromboplastin time Blood samples are collected in tubes with oxalate or citrate to arrest coagulation by binding calcium. The specimen is then delivered to the laboratory. In order to activate the intrinsic pathway, phospholipid, an activator (such as silica, celite, kaolin, ellagic acid), and calcium (to reverse the anticoagulant effect of the oxalate) are mixed into the plasma sample . The time is measured until a thrombus (clot) forms. The test is termed \"paial\" due to the absence of tissue factor from the reaction mixture The typical reference range is between 25 seconds and 39 s (depending on laboratory). Shoening of the PTT has little clinical relevance. Normal PTT times require the presence of the following coagulation factors: I, II, V, VIII, IX, X, XI, and XII. Notably, deficiencies in factors VII or XIII will not be detected with the PTT test. Prolonged APTT may indicate: - Use of heparin (or contamination of the sample) - Antiphospholipid antibody (especially lupus anticoagulant, which paradoxically increases propensity to thrombosis) - Coagulation factor deficiency (e.g. hemophilia) To distinguish the above causes, mixing tests are performed, in which the patient's plasma is mixed (initially at a 50:50 dilution) with normal plasma. If the abnormality does not disappear, the sample is said to contain an \"inhibitor\" (either heparin, antiphospholipid antibodies or coagulation factor specific inhibitors), while if it does correct a factor deficiency is more likely.

{"question": "Increased osmotic fragility is characteristic of:September 2009", "exp": "Ans. A: Hereditary spherocytosisThe normal red blood cell is a relatively impermeable biconcave disc which maintains osmotic equilibrium with the surrounding medium. As the surrounding medium becomes hypotonic, fluid will be taken into the cell to maintain stability. Eventually under very hypotonic conditions the cell will fill to capacity and rupture. Spherocytic red blood cells have a decreased capacity to expand, and will rupture in mildly hypotonic conditions that fail to lyse normal red cells. They thus exhibit increased osmotic fragility.Osmotic fragility is determined by measuring the degree of hemolysis in hypotonic saline solution. With the unincubated test, red cell osmotic fragility is considered to be increased if hemolysis occurs in a sodium chloride concentration > 0.5%. Although increased osmotic fragility is characteristically associated with hereditary spherocytosis, it may also be increased in other types of hemolytic anemia associated with the presence of spherocytes, paicularly auto-immune hemolytic anemia, and in hypernatermia (Na > 155 meq/L).Often the increased osmotic fragility in spherocytosis is limited to a small fraction of cells that are unusually susceptible to lysis. After incubation, the defect is magnified, and a striking increase in fragility will be seen in hereditary spherocytosis. Osmotic fragility is considered to be decreased if hemolysis is not complete in a 0.30% NaC1 solution.

{"question": "Definitive managenment in primary angle closure glaucoma: March 2005", "exp": "Ans. C: Laser iridotomy Although intraocular pressure is only one of the major risk factors for glaucoma, lowering it various pharmaceuticals and/or surgical techniques is currently the mainstay of glaucoma treatment. A. Medications used for lowering intraocular tension: Prostaglandin analogs like latanoprost, bimatoprost and travoprost increase uveoscleral outflow of aqueous humor. Bimatoprost also increases trabecular outflow Topical beta-adrenergic receptor antagonists such as timolol, levobunolol, and betaxolol decrease aqueous humor production by the ciliary body. Alpha2-adrenergic agonists such as brimonidine work by a dual mechanism, decreasing aqueous production and increasing uveo-scleral outflow. Less-selective sympathomimetics like epinephrine and dipivefrin increase outflow of aqueous humor through trabecular meshwork and possibly through uveoscleral outflow pathway, probably by a beta2-agonist action. Miotic agents parasympathomimetics like pilocarpine work by contraction of the ciliary muscle, tightening the trabecular meshwork and allowing increased outflow of the aqueous humour. Carbonic anhydrase inhibitors like dorzolamide, brinzolamide, acetazolamide lower secretion of aqueous humor by inhibiting carbonic anhydrase in the ciliary body. B. Conventional surgery to treat glaucoma makes a new opening in the meshwork. This new opening helps fluid to leave the eye and lowers intraocular pressure. Canaloplasty is a nonpenetrating procedure utilizing microcatheter technology. By opening the canal, the pressure inside the eye may be relieved. Laser trabeculoplasty may be used to treat open angle glaucoma. It is a temporary solution, not a cure. Nd: YAG Laser peripheral iridotomy reduces the risk of developing an attack of acute angle closure. In most cases it also reduces the risk of developing chronic angle closure or of adhesions of the iris to the trabecular meshwork. It is mandatory after reducing the intraocular pressure in all eyes with any form of primary angle-closure glaucoma and also prophylactically in the unaffected eye.

C: Continuous bladder drainage Postoperative details Bladder drainage: continuous bladder drainage postoperatively is vital for successful vesicovaginal repair. A large-caliber catheter minimizes the potential for catheter blockage by blood clots, mucus, and calcaneus deposits. - Type and duration of catheter drainage: For fistulas involving the lower poion of the bladder trigone, bladder neck, or urethra, transurethral bladder catheters should not be used. A large suprapubic catheter is preferable to minimize excess tension on the suture line and to ensure nonobstructed continuous drainage. In posthysterectomy VVF repairs, both transurethral and suprapubic catheters may be placed.Surgeries to repair pelvic radiotherapy-associated VVFs require longer periods of drainage. Acidification of urine to diminish risks of cystitis, mucus production, and formation of bladder calculi is a consideration for patients with an indwelling catheter. Vitamin C or methenamine mandelate can be used. Estrogen replacement therapy in the postmenopausal patient may assist with optimizing tissue vascularization and healing. Control of postoperative bladder spasms: Urised iseffective for control of postoperative bladder spasms. It is a combination of antiseptics (methenamine, methylene blue, phenyl salicylate, and benzoic acid) and parasympatholytics (tropine sulfate, and hyoscyamine sulfate). Antibiotic therapy: Close follow-up and prompt evaluation for any urinary tract infections and antibiotic therapy, when indicated, are mandatory. Minimizing Valsalva maneuvers: Stool softeners and a high-fiber diet postoperatively minimize Valsalva maneuvers in the patient. Examinations: Avoid pelvic and speculum vaginal examinations during the first 3 months.

{"question": "All of the following are seen in retinitis pigmentosa except: September 2009", "exp": "Ans. A: Prominent retinal vessels The condition is abiotrophic in nature (premature senility and death of tissue) and genetically determined. Autosomal recessive is the most common and is very severe. Autosomal dominant is benign and is symptomatic only in adult life. X-linked recessive is least common. It is also a very severe form. Degeneration of rods commences near the equator. Macular region is not affected until late in the disease. The symptoms of retinitis pigmentosa are characteristic, the most prominent being defective vision in the dusk (night blindness/nyctalopia). It is due to degeneration of rods, which are primarily responsible for vision in low illumination. The visual field show concentric reduction. In early cases a paial or complete annular/ring scotoma is found. As the disease progresses the field becomes gradually smaller until at last it is reduced to a restricted area around the fixation point (tubular vision).Hence person has difficulty in moving about. Initially the equatorial region is affected. Ophthalmoscopic findings in the affected zones shows the retina studded with small, jet black spots resembling bone corpuscles with a spidery outline. The retinal pigment epithelium becomes transparent so that the choroid vessels become visible and the fundus appears tessellated or tigroid. The retinal veins, never the aeries, often have a sheath of pigment for pa of their course. The retinal vessels becomes extremely attenuated and thread like. The disc exhibits the characteristics of primary optic atrophy. It is pale and have a wax like yellowish appearance and is often termed as 'consecutive optic atrophy' (Ganglion cells destroyed with degeneration of the axial cylinders and optic nerve is known as consecutive atrophy). Ocular associations of retinitis pigmentosa are myopia, chronic simple glaucoma. Systemic associations of retinitis pigmentosa are in the form of various syndromes: Laurence - Moon - Biedl syndrome - obesity, hypogonadism, polydactyly and mental retardation. Usher's syndrome - deaf mutism. Secondary retinitis pigmentosa due to infections like syphilis, mumps, German measles (rubella) and due to drug like chloroquine must be differentiated from primary retinitis pigmentosa.
