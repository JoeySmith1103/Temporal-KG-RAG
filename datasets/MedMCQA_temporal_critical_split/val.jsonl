The spleen enlarges because the children are in a state of hypersplenism, in which the spleen vigorously phagocytizes any abnormally shaped erythrocytes. During the first decade of life, sickling within the spleen occludes its blood flow, causing repeated small infarctions, leading to \"autosplenectomy.\" The autosplenectomy is actually helpful to the patient hematologically, as it may ameliorate the chronic anemia. Unfounately, the lack of a functional spleen renders the patients susceptible to infections with Salmonella and encapsulated organisms such as Streptococcus pneumoniae and Haemophilus influenzae.

Which of the following is the most likely underlying condition?", "exp": "This patient displays signs of oculomotor palsy, with restriction of the eye movements in all directions (except laterally, due to preservation of the sixth cranial nerve, the abducens), and ptosis. Dilatation of the pupil, which fails to react to light, is a sign of intracranial compression of the third, or oculomotor cranial nerve. This should prompt search for an underlying surgical cause of oculomotor palsy. Uncal herniation and aneurysm of the posterior communicating aery are the two most common surgical conditions leading to oculomotor palsy. In the absence of clinical evidence of increased intracranial pressure, it may be assumed that the patient has an aneurysm of the posterior communicating aery until proven otherwise. Cerebral angiography is the investigation of choice to confirm the diagnosis. All of the most common medical causes of oculomotor nerve palsy result in paresis of extraocular movements and ptosis, but the pupillary light reflex is preserved.

Hot - a hot nodule is one that takes up isotope, while the surrounding thyroid tissue is inactive because the hot nodule is producing such high levels of thyroid hormones that TSH secretion is suppressed. Warm nodule - a warm nodule takes up isotope and so does normal thyroid tissue around it. Cold nodule - it takes up no isotope. The cold nodules carry a higher risk for malignancy. But a 'cold' nodule does not necessarily mean malignant. Only 20% of cold nodules turn out to be malignant, and about 5% of hot nodules can be malignant. Thus routine isotope scanning is no longer used to distinguish benign from malignant. FNAC is the investigation of choice for solitary thyroid nodule. The finding of a malignant diagnosis on FNAC is associated with a high accuracy rate (-100%), but false negative rate of FNAC is high (1-6%). Thus benign nodules should be kept under observation. An inconclusive FNA needs aggressive management. A repeat FNA is done. If still inconclusive, the pt. can be kept under observation if risk factors are low. Alternatively, if risk factors are high as in the present case, the pt. can undergo hemithyroidectomy to remove the nodule and sent for histopathology.

Physical examination reveals a firm, tender uterus with frequent contractions, which confirms the diagnosis. The fact that a clot forms within 4 min suggests that coagulopathy is not present. Because abruption is often accompanied by hemorrhaging, it is important that appropriate fluids (i.e., lactated Ringer solution and whole blood) be administered immediately to stabilize the mother's circulation. Cesarean section may be necessary in the case of a severe abruption, but only when fetal distress is evident or delivery is unlikely to be accomplished vaginally Internal monitoring equipment should provide an early warning that the fetus is compromised.

The prognosis in ankylosing spondylitis is generally good, with only 6% dying of the disease itself. While pulmonary fibrosis and restrictive lung disease can occur, they are rarely a cause of death (cervical fracture, heart block, and amyloidosis are leading causes of death as a result of ankylosing spondylitis).

It is an opioid and readily crosses the placenta; therefore, the fetus is exposed to the medication. As an opioid, it causes respiratory depression. Neonates are at greatest risk for respiratory depression when delivery occurs approximately 2 to 3 hours after meperidine is administered to the mother. This neonate was born approximately 2 hours after maternal administration of meperidine, which makes neonatal respiratory depression likely. Naloxone is a pure opioid antagonist that displaces the opioid from its receptor sites and can help to reverse the opioid- induced respiratory depression. It has a sho duration of action so repeat doses may be necessary. Blood transfusion would not be indicated. Blood transfusions are used when there is evidence that the neonate is anemic. This neonate appears to have respiratory depression and not anemia. Therefore, naloxone, and not blood transfusion, would be indicated. Glucose should be given when there is evidence that the neonate is severely hypoglycemic. This neonate, given that its mother received an opioid 2 hours ago, is most likely to have respiratory depression from the opioid and not hypoglycemia. Sodium bicarbonate should be given to a neonate for documented metabolic acidosis. It is often used during a prolonged resuscitation.

Grave's disease is an autoimmune disorder in which a thyroid-stimulating IgG immunoglobulin (TSI) binds to the TSH receptors causing increased release of thyroid hormone. The exophthalmos is caused by lymphocytic infiltration of the extraocular muscles. Hashimoto's thyroiditis results in hypothyroidism and is associated with a diffusely enlarged thyroid gland and antimicrosomal antibodies against the thyroid parenchyma. Multinodular toxic goiter causes hypehyroidism, but does not result in exophthalmos. Papillary carcinoma will only very rarely present as a hypersecreting nodule. Most cases will be nonsecreting, cold nodules. There is no exophthalmos. This is the most common thyroid cancer and has the best prognosis of all thyroid cancers. Ref: Cooper D.S., Ladenson P.W.

Immunity to the causative organism is based on?", "exp": "The patient in this question has pneumococcal pneumonia, which must be considered in any patient with chills, fever, chest pain, and cough productive of purulent, rust-colored sputum. Streptococcus pneumoniae is an alpha;-hemolytic, gram-positive coccus that grows in chains. It can be easily distinguished from other alpha;-hemolytic streptococci because it is exquisitely sensitive to bile and bile like compounds, such as optochin. It is the most common cause of community-acquired pneumonia and the most common cause of community-acquired meningitis in adults older than 30. The only recognized virulence factor of S. pneumoniae is its carbohydrate capsule (which contains acidic polysaccharides). Antibody to a specific capsule type is necessary to overcome infection. More than 80 capsule types have been recognized. The 23 types that most commonly cause disease are contained in a vaccine that is recommended for high-risk groups, including the elderly and those undergoing splenectomy. Increased susceptibility is also found in patients with Hodgkin disease, chronic lymphocytic leukemia, and myeloma. The vaccine should still be given to patients with these conditions, but it is less successful. The alternative complement pathway is impoant in clearing Neisseria infections. Individuals with deficiencies in C5 through C8 are at increased risk of disease from Neisseria. The fimbria of Streptococcus pyogenes (Group A alpha;-hemolytic streptococcus) is composed of an a-helically coiled M protein. Antibody against a specific M type will prevent infection. However, raising antibodies to M proteins can lead to rheumatic fever, so Strep throat infections are routinely treated with penicillin to prevent an antibody response. The C carbohydrate is an antigen of alpha;-hemolytic streptococci used to divide them into different groups. Antibody against C carbohydrate is not protective. Ref: Brooks G.F. (2013). Chapter 14.

Most often, these aspiration events occur with the use of general anesthesia. Pregnant patients are at greater risk for aspiration because of the delayed gastric emptying that occurs during pregnancy and labor. Pregnancy is associated with increased levels of progesterone and displacement of the pylorus by the pregnant uterus. Labor is associated with pain and stress. All of these factors lead to delayed gastric emptying. Aspiration pneumonitis is caused by acidic gastric juices entering the lungs and inducing a sometimes-lethal chemical pneumonitis. When epidural anesthesia is administered, there is a risk of complications, including the development of total spinal anesthesia. The treatment for this complication is positive-pressure ventilation with 100% oxygen administered through an endotracheal tube. Therefore, when an epidural is going to be placed, the patient should be given an antacid to increase the stomach pH. This will help to prevent aspiration pneumonitis should an aspiration event take place during the administration of general anesthesia. It is not necessary to give an antibiotic prior to the administration of an epidural. Antibiotics are used during labor for the prevention of group B Streptococcus sepsis, for patients with chorioamnionitis, for patients in need of valve or endocarditis prophylaxis, or during cesarean delivery for the prevention of infection. Aspirin is not given prior to the placement of an epidural. A clear liquid meal should not be given to patients prior to the placement of an epidural.

On physical examination, there is tender swelling of the right calf without erythema. His D-dimer is 640 ng/mL. Venous Doppler of the right leg reveals occlusive thrombi in the deep veins. A plan is made to initiate anticoagulation and to extend the treatment for 6 months.What will be the drug of choice for anticoagulation for this patient?", "exp": "Malignancy is a recognized risk factor for venous thromboembolism (VTE), and VTE is the second leading cause of death in cancer patients. Procoagulant molecules expressed both by cancer cells and host tissue contribute to this condition. Low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) is the preferred anticoagulant for long-term treatment in patients with cancer. When compared with warfarin, LMWH reduces the rate of recurrent VTE without significant risk of bleeding. Newer anticoagulants such as rivaroxaban have not been adequately tested for cancer-induced VTE yet.Young patients with unprovoked VTE, a history of unexplained VTE, or family history of VTE raise the suspicion of an inherited hypercoagulable disorder. The common inherited hypercoagulable disorders are Factor V Leiden mutation, prothrombin gene mutation, protein S deficiency, protein C deficiency, antithrombin III deficiency, dysfibrinogenemia, and antiphospholipid antibody syndrome. When inherited hypercoagulable disorders are strongly suspected, tests for above mentioned disorders can be ordered. In the event of an acute thrombosis, however, it is not recommended to test for protein C, protein S, and anti-thrombin III since active coagulation can reduce the plasma concentration of these proteins resulting in false-positive result. To avoid confusion, it is recommended to order only Factor V Leiden mutation, prothrombin gene mutation, and antiphospholipid antibody with acute VTE or when patients are on warfarin.Warfarin-induced skin necrosis results from a transient hypercoagulable state. Warfarin initially affects all the vitamin K-dependent clotting proteins (Factors II, VII, IX, X, and proteins C and S). Since Protein C has a short half-life (8-12 hours), the serum protein C concentration drops quickly to 50% of normal in first 24 hours. Since circulating levels of other vitamin K-dependent proteins are still high, this gives rise to a hypercoagulable state which may cause microthrombi in the dermal and subcutaneous vessels, resulting in skin necrosis. The risk is particularly high in case of congenital protein C deficiency; nearly one-third cases of warfarin-induced skin necrosis are associated with congenital protein C deficiency.", "cop": 2, "opa": "Rivaroxaban", "opb": "Low-molecular-weight heparin", "opc": "Warfarin", "opd": "Low dose aspirin (81 mg/d)", "subject_name": "Medicine", "topic_name": "Oncology", "id": "04655e21-daa9-4196-b795-4526a6e912ca", "choice_type": "single", "idx": 113098, "temporal_analysis": {"is_temporal_critical": true, "temporal_pairs": [{"entity": "swelling of the right calf", "duration": "for past 2 days"}, {"entity": "pain", "duration": "for past 2 days"}], "duration_text": "for past 2 days", "duration_bucket": "days", "onset_type": "sudden", "pattern": "none", "temporal_features": ["sudden onset", "duration of 2 days"], "counterfactual_change": "change_answer", "minimal_temporal_edit": null, "reasoning": "The explicit temporal information regarding the sudden onset and the duration of symptoms for the past 2 days is critical for differentiating between possible diagnoses, such as deep vein thrombosis versus other causes of calf swelling and pain.

The mechanism of hypersensitivity involves prior sensitization of a population of TH2 cells that produced cytokines, including interleukin-4. The interleukin-4 causes B cells to switch their heavy chain class from IgM to IgE. The IgE molecules then attach to mast cells or basophils. With subsequent antigen (allergen) challenge, the mast cells degranulate and release mediators, including histamine, which produces the anaphylactic response. Eosinophils are involved in type I hypersensitivity reactions as well as type II antibody-dependent cell cytotoxicity reactions directed against parasites. Eosinophils enter the area of the reaction due to the release of eosinophil chemotactic factor (eotaxin) and the beta-chemokine RANTES released from TH2 CD4+ cells and mast cells. Eosinophils are recruited into the tissues as pa of the late-phase reaction of type I hypersensitivity. Their survival in tissue is dependent upon IL-3, IL-5, and granulocyte-monocyte colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF) released from TH2 cells. Megakaryocytes are bone marrow cells that produces platelets. They are not involved in type I hypersensitivity.

{"question": "A 36-year-old man presents to his physician complaining of right scrotal swelling. He states that the swelling has been present for 1 week. He initially noticed the swelling sholy after moving furniture for his new living room. He denies any nausea, vomiting, change in bowel habits, abdominal pain, or urinary tract symptoms. He has no other significant medical or surgical history. On examination, he has an enlarged right hemi-scrotum with a mass that appears to be originating at the level of the external inguinal ring. With the patient completely relaxed, the physician is able to reduce the mass by pushing it back through the external inguinal ring. With the mass reduced, the physician instructs the patient to perform a Valsalva maneuver, upon which a protrusion is felt at the external inguinal ring. Once the mass is reduced, the testicle appears normal in size and consistency. Which of the following pathological processes might cause the patient's underlying condition to occur in an infant?", "exp": "The pathologic process that causes hernias is different in neonates and infants than in an adult. Embryologically, in the seventh week, the testes begin descending from their location at the 10th thoracic level into the scrotum. After the eighth week, a peritoneal evagination called the processus vaginalis forms just anterior to the gubernaculum. The gubernaculum is a condensation of peritoneum that attaches superiorly to the gonad and inferiorly to the fascia that is developing between the external and internal oblique muscles in the region of the labioscrotal swellings. The processus vaginalis pushes out as a \"sock-like\" extension into the transversalis fascia, the internal oblique muscle, and the external oblique muscle, thus forming the inguinal canal. After the processus vaginalis has evaginated into the scrotum, the gubernaculum shoen and simply pull the gonads through the canal. Within the first year after bih, the superior poion of the processus vaginalis is usually obliterated, leaving only a distal remnant sac, the tunica vaginalis, which lies anterior to the testis. During infancy, this sac wraps around most of the testis. Its lumen is normally collapsed, but under pathologic conditions it may fill with serous secretions, forming a testicular hydrocele. If the processus vaginalis remains patent, a connection between the abdominal cavity and scrotal sac will occur. Loops of intestine may herniate into this processus, resulting in an indirect inguinal hernia. Note: In adults, hernias are caused by a protrusion of a structure, usually intestine, through a tissue that normally contains it. Direct inguinal hernias occur through the floor of the inguinal canal separate from the spermatic cord. Direct inguinal hernias occur because of a breakdown of the transversus abdominis aponeurosis and transversalis fascia. An indirect inguinal hernia occurs through the internal inguinal ring in a protrusion of peritoneum along the spermatic cord in the internal spermatic fascia. Therefore, a large indirect inguinal hernia will descend into the scrotum along the spermatic cord. Spigelian hernias are rare and occur due to a weakness in the linea semilunaris, which is located at the lateral margin of the rectus sheath.

The most common form in children is postinfectious, following a lower airway tract infection with adenovirus, although influenza, rubeola, Bordetella, and Mycoplasma are also implicated. Persons with bronchiolitis obliterans usually experience dyspnea, coughing, and exercise intolerance. This diagnosis should be considered in children with persistent cough, wheezing, crackles, or hypoxemia persisting longer than 60 days following a lower respiratory tract infection. Chest radiograph abnormalities include evidence of heterogeneous air trapping and airway wall thickening.Ventilation-perfusion scans show a pattern of ventilation and perfusion mismatch. Pulmonary angiograms reveal decreased vasculature in involved lung, and bronchograms show marked pruning of the bronchial tree. Classic findings on chest high-resolution CT include a mosaic perfusion pattern, vascular attenuation, and central bronchiectasis. Suppoive care including supplemental oxygen for hypoxemia, routine vaccination, avoidance of environmental irritant exposure, exercise, and nutritional suppo should be provided. Ongoing airway damage due to problems such as aspiration should be prevented. Inhaled bronchodilators may reverse airway obstruction if the disease has a reactive component. Coicosteroids (inhaled, daily, or pulse dosing) may help reverse the obstruction or prevent ongoing damage.

{"question": "Raja Devi 45 yrs old women present with history of polymenorrhea for last six months. The first line of management is :", "exp": "Ans. is c i.e. Dilatation and curettage Friends. I have given these questions (36 and 37) together, so that you understand the difference between the two. Question 36 asks : Polymenorrhea in a 45 years old woman for 6 months - first line of management. Whereas question 37 asks : Polymenorrhea in a 45 years old woman for 6 months - best line of management. Another thing which I want to point out here is : Question is on \"Polymenorrhea' and not DUB (Which generally refers to anovulatory DUB). As far as first line of management is concerned definately I would investigate the patient to rule out endometrial cancer. In this process I would perform diagnostic D & C . \"In the later reproductive years, even more care must be given to exclude pathological cause because of the possibility of endometrial cancer. Aspiration, curettage or both should clearly establish anovulatory or dyssynchronous cycles as the cause before hormone therapy is staed.\" As far as medical therapy is concerned : In ovulatory cycles - combined oral pills for 3 cycles is given. But staing OCP's in a perimenopausal female without prior investigations is not recommended. Now comes the -tricky\" pa : Best line of management in such cases. As far as D & C is concerned : \"Therapeutic curettage is of no value in the treatment of polymenorrhea.\" So, now we are left with 2 options either medical management with OCP's or hysterectomy. The place of surgery in the treatment of excessive bleeding without an organic basis varies with the age of the patient; it should be a last reso in young girls but may be considered earlier in women above the age of 40 years. Neveheless, in the latter group it is good practice to exclude organic disease by ultrasound and endometrial aspiration, to try medical therapy and proceed to hysterectomy if the response is inadequate or not sustained. When the patient is above 40 years of age, and when the hemorrhage fails to respond to simpler measure, hysterectomy is indicated. It is the treatment of choice in all cases of persistent or recurrent postmenopausal bleeding for which there is no obvious cause. Therefore, hysterectomy is the last reso, first medical management is tried. Hysterectomy personally I feel is not the best treatment as it is a major surgery, has its own complications and high rate of morbidity.

This agent should be administered intravenously as soon as cyanotic congenital heart disease is clinically suspected and continued through the preoperative period and during cardiac catheterization.v) Morphine 0.1 to 0.2 mg/kg subcutaneous inj.vi) Correction of acidosis with sodium bicarbonate IV.vii) Propranolol: 0.5 - 1 mg/kg/IV - to decrease the frequency and severity of hypercyanotic spells, but with the excellent surgical results available today, surgical treatment is now indicated as soon as spells begin.viii) Vasopressors: Methoxamine or phenylephrine.ix) Correction of Anaemia.", "cop": 4, "opa": "PGE 1 infusion", "opb": "O2 therapy", "opc": "Propranolol", "opd": "All of the above", "subject_name": "Pediatrics", "topic_name": "C.V.S.", "id": "dbac705d-60c8-4b93-913c-dd6afb03dcee", "choice_type": "multi", "idx": 153155, "temporal_analysis": {"is_temporal_critical": true, "temporal_pairs": [{"entity": "worsening of TOF", "duration": "sudden"}], "duration_text": "sudden worsening", "duration_bucket": "none", "onset_type": "sudden", "pattern": "waxing-waning", "temporal_features": ["sudden onset"], "counterfactual_change": "change_answer", "minimal_temporal_edit": null, "reasoning": "The question contains explicit temporal information ('sudden worsening') which is essential for clinical reasoning as it helps differentiate between acute and chronic presentations of TOF.

{"question": "A baby, who was apparently normal at bih, develops persistent regurgitation and vomiting in the second and third weeks of life. No fever is present and hematologic studies and blood chemistries are normal. Which of the following therapies is most likely to be effective in this case?", "exp": "The baby probably has congenital hyperophic pyloric stenosis, which usually presents at several weeks of age. Paial surgical incision through the pylorus (pyloromyotomy) is usually curative. Antacids are beneficial in esophageal reflux and peptic ulcer disease. Barium enema can reverse intussusception in a child, but would not be therapeutic in this case. Gastric resection is not indicated, since the much less invasive procedure of pyloromyotomy is actually more effective. Ref: Hackam D.J., Grikscheit T.C., Wang K.S., Newman K.D., Ford H.R. (2010).
