Fractures across the growth plate may produce bony bridges that will cause premature cessation of growth or angular deformities of the extremity. These bridges are due to the trauma to the growth plate and can occur even with adequate reductions.Epiphysial fractures around the shoulder, wrist, and fingers can usually be treated by closed reduction, but fractures of the epiphyses around the elbow often require open reduction. In the lower extremity, accurate reduction of the epiphysial plate is necessary to prevent joint deformity when a joint surface is involved. If angular deformities result, corrective osteotomy may be necessary.Reference: Erickson M.A., Merritt C., Polousky J.D. (2012). Chapter 26. Orthopedics. In W.W. Hay, Jr., M.J. Levin, R.R.

{"question": "A patient with previously normal haemoglobin suffered a sudden massive acute hemorrhage. He is most likely to show all of the following except:", "exp": "Ans. c. High packed cell volume Packed cell volume Packed cell volume (PCV) or hematocrit determines the percentage of red blood cells in the plasma. Decrease in hematocrit PCV in the early hours after acute hemorrhage is usually the result of volume resuscitation rather than ongoing blood loss. The body adjusts to severe hemorrhage by expanding the circulating volume at the expense of extravascular fluid. However, within several hours after hemorrhage plasma volume begins to increase due to shift of interstitial fluid into vascular space RBCs cannot be replaced quickly as the bone marrow takes approximately ten days to produce mature RBCs. As a result PCV done several hours after bleeding episode will show more accurate picture of the hematocrit (Le. decreased PCV). The changes in hematocrit show poor correlation with blood volume deficits and erythrocyte deficits in acute hemorrhage.

Physical examination, including careful cranial nerve and deep tendon reflex testing, is otherwise normal.

This occurs with leakage or rupture of an intracranial aneurysm, usually located at an arterial bifurcation in the anterior cerebral circulation. Rupture may occur spontaneously or at times of exercise. About 2% of persons have \"berry\" aneurysms. Fortunately only a small percentage of these persons ever experience rupture, which may be fatal. The headache that precedes or accompanies SAH is severe and often described as a \"thunderclap\" headache, meaning that it reaches its maximum intensity in seconds. Migraine may also cause severe headache, but usually reaches maximum intensity in 5 to 30 minutes. Syncope occurs in about one-half of patients with SAH and is thought to be due to accompanying cerebral artery spasm Blood in the cerebrospinal fluid irritates the meninges and may cause neck stiffness. Suspected subarachnoid hemorrhage mandates CT scanning as the initial test. In about 90% of patients, there will be enough blood to be visualized on a non contrast CT scan. A contrast CT scan sometimes obscures the diagnosis because, in an enhanced scan, normal arteries may be mistaken for subarachnoid blood. If the CT scan is normal, a lumbar puncture will establish the diagnosis by demonstrating blood in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). As opposed to CSF blood from a traumatic lumbar puncture, the CSF blood does not clear with continued collection of fluid. Cerebral angiography is necessary to assess the need for surgery and to detect other aneurysms, but it is usually delayed because angiography may precipitate spasm, especially if performed immediately after the acute rupture.

(Ref: Kaplan & Sadock's Synopsis of Psychiatry, Xth/Ch. 13, Pg. 476).A 28-year-old female presents with complain of reduced sleep with disorganized behavior since 9 months. She feels there is a camera fixed behind her head, which always follows her. The most likely diagnosis would be Paranoid schizophrenia.Discussion:Depending on the predominance of particular symptoms, four subtypes of schizophrenia are recognized: paranoid, disorganized, catatonic, and residual.The female in the question presents with the classic symptoms of paranoid schizophrenia. This subtype of schizophrenia is characterized by prominent hallucinations and delusional ideations with a relative preservation of affect and cognitive functions. Delusions are usually grandiose or persecutory or both, organized around a central coherent theme. Hallucinations, usually auditory, are frequent and related to the delusional theme. Anxiety, anger, argumentativeness, and aloofness are often present. Paranoid schizophrenia tends to develop later in life and is associated with a better prognosis.Kaplan, pg. 546......Patient with a major depression with psychotic features should have symptoms over two weeks (the minimum for the diagnosis), and symptoms include anhedonia, crying, anergia, decreased concentration, weight loss, and insomnia with early morning awakening. Patient also may have somatic delusions that are mood congruent and an auditory hallucination. The presence of psychotic phenomena that follow a clear mood disorder picture makes the diagnosis of major depression with psychotic features the most likely.Kaplan, pg. 512-520........The main feature of delusional disorder is the presence of one or more nonbizarre delusions without deterioration of psychosocial functioning and in the absence of bizarre or odd behavior. Auditory and visual hallucinations, if present, are not prominent and are related to the delusional theme. Tactile and olfactory hallucinations may also be present if they are incorporated in the delusional system (such as feeling insects crawling over the skin in delusions of infestation). Subtypes of delusional disorder include erotomanic, gran- diose, jealous, persecutory, and somatic (delusions of being infested with parasites, of emitting a bad odor, of having AIDS). Delusional disorder usually manifests in middle or late adult life and has a fluctuating course with periods of remissions and relapses.Additional Educational points:# Amphetamine intoxication can result in a psychosis very closely resembling acute paranoid schizophrenia, with symptoms including paranoid delusions and visual hallucinations.# Persons with a paranoid personality disorder characteristically show marked suspiciousness of others and are extremely sensitive to any potential threat or injustice. They frequently look for hidden motives or meanings, are contemptuous of the weak, and are very sensitive to issues of power and dominance. They often are moralistic or self- righteous and may be quite litigious.

The hair follicle then enters the telogen phase, which is a relatively fixed period of time, approximately 100 days, regardless of the size of the hair follicle. There is no growth of the hair shaft during this phase. It is at the end of the telogen phase that the entire hair shaft, also often referred to as the club hair, will spontaneously shed, while a new hair shaft is forming within the hair canal. The white bulb at the end of the hair, along with the loosely attached collection of friable debris gives the shed hair its characteristic appearance. In the scalp of the healthy, young human adult, approximately 90% of the hair will be in the anagen (growth) phase and approximately 10% will be in the telogen (dormancy) phase.Less than 1% will be in the catagen (transitional) phase.What is Telogen Effluvium??When excessive amounts of hair simultaneously switch from anagen (growth) into telogen (dormancy) and subsequently shed several months later, the phenomenon is referred to as a telogen effluvium.Telogen effluviums can be acute or chronic.What causes Telogen Effluvium?In order to cause a large number of hair follicles to simultaneously switch from the anagen (growing) phase into the telogen (resting) phase, the body has to undergo some systemic insult.A telogen effluvium is not caused by topical medications. But because there is a required time lapse of several months between the inciting cause and the excessive shedding of hair, the exact cause of the telogen effluvium is often not positively identified.A typical and common case of telogen effluvium would be the episode of severe shedding of hair that may occur approximately 100 days after a woman has given birth. The inciting factor is probably the abrupt hormonal changes that occur at the end of pregnancy. All of the hair grows back within a year.Other causes of telogen effluvium include illness,major physicaltrauma,menopause,crash diets,severe psychological stress,major surgery (especially with general anesthesia),hypo- or hyperthyroidism,anemia's,acute and severe blood loss,heavy metal poisoning, etc.Chronic illness such as malignancy, and any chronic debilitating illness,such as systemic lupus erythematosus,end-stage renal disease, - or liver disease can cause telogen effluvium.InfectionsTyphoid, malaria, dengue Anagen effluviumAnagen effluvium is the loss of anagen hair which typically happens after radiation therapy of chemotherapy especially with alkylating agents.", "cop": 2, "opa": "Androgenic alopecia", "opb": "Telogen effuvium", "opc": "Anagen effuvium", "opd": "Alopecia areata", "subject_name": "Skin", "topic_name": "Anatomy of Skin", "id": "d9beac3a-28f7-427c-b04a-7c0aed9ed11f", "choice_type": "single", "idx": 134145, "temporal_analysis": {"is_temporal_critical": true, "temporal_pairs": [{"entity": "hair loss", "duration": "for 1 month"}, {"entity": "enteric fever", "duration": "before 4 months"}], "duration_text": null, "duration_bucket": "months-years", "onset_type": "unknown", "pattern": "none", "temporal_features": ["duration of hair loss", "duration of enteric fever"], "counterfactual_change": "change_answer", "minimal_temporal_edit": null, "reasoning": "The explicit temporal expressions regarding the duration of hair loss and the timing of enteric fever are critical for differentiating potential diagnoses.

Although disease caused by M. pneumoniae can be contracted year-round, thousands of cases occur during the winter months in all age groups. The disease, if untreated, will persist for 2 weeks or longer. Rare but serious side effects include cardiomyopathies and central nervous system complications. Infection with M. pneumoniae may be treated with either erythromycin or tetracycline. The organism lacks a cell wall and so is resistant to the penicillin and the cephalosporin groups of antibiotics. Until recently, diagnostic tests have been of limited value. Up to 50% of cases may not show cold agglutinins, an insensitive and nonspecific acute-phase reactant. However, if cold agglutinins are present, a quick diagnosis can be made if signs and symptoms are characteristic. Complement fixation tests that measure an antibody to a glycolipid antigen of M. pneumoniae are useful but not routinely performed in most laboratories. Also, cross-reactions may occur. Culture of M. pneumoniae, while not technically difficult, may take up to 2 weeks before visible growth is observed. A DNA probe is available. It is an 125I probe for the 16S ribosomal RNA of M. pneumoniae. Evaluations in a number of laboratories indicate that compared with culture it is highly sensitive and specific.

This occurs during the end stages of cirrhosis and is characterized by diminished urine output and low urinary sodium. In the setting of end-stage liver disease, renal vasoconstriction occurs, and the distal convoluted tubule responds by conserving sodium. Unless the renal function is allowed to deteriorate fuher, liver transplantation will reverse this vasoconstriction and kidney function will return to normal.A large volume paracentesis may relieve the ascites but will have no significant benefit on the impaired renal function. There are no indications in this question to suggest that the patient requires acute hemodialysis. A mesocaval shunt is a surgical procedure that may decompress the poal pressure but will not have any benefit on renal function.

{"question": "A female infant is born approximately 10 weeks prematurely (at 30 weeks) and weighs 1710 gm. She has respiratory distress syndrome and is treated with endogenous surfactant. She is intubated endotracheally with mechanical ventilation immediately after bih. Over the first 4 days after bih the ventilator pressure and the fraction of inspired oxygen are reduced. Beginning on the fifth day after bih, she has brief desaturations that become more persistent. She needs increased ventilator and oxygen suppo on the seventh day after bih. She becomes cyanotic. Fuher examination, echocardiogram, and x-rays reveal left atrial enlargement, an enlarged pulmonary aery, increased pulmonary vasculature, and a continuous machine-like murmur. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?", "exp": "Patent ductus aeriosus. The presence of a murmur could be indicative of any of the conditions. The presence of a continuous machine-like murmur is indicative of a patent ductus aeriosus (PDA). Usually, as in this case, the premature baby with PDA does not acutely become cyanotic and ill, although brief desaturations can occur that become more persistent. An atrial septal defect (ASD), such as a persistent foramen ovale, could be eliminated from the diagnosis because the murmur would be heard as an abnormal splitting of the second sound during expiration (answer a). A patent foramen ovale is a common echo finding in premature babies and is usually not followed up unless it appears remarkable to the pediatric cardiologist or there is a persistent murmur. A patent foramen ovale might result in only minimal or intermittent cyanosis during crying or straining to pass stool. A murmur caused by a ventricular septal defect (VSD, answer c), occurs between the first and second hea sounds (S1and S2) and is described as holosystolic (pansystolic) because the amplitude is high throughout systole. Pulmonary stenosis would be heard as a harsh systolic ejection murmur (answer d). PDA refers to the maintenance of the ductus aeriosus, a normal fetal structure. In the fetus, the ductus aeriosus allows blood to bypass the pulmonary circulation, since the lungs are not involved in CO2/O2exchange until after bih. The placenta subserves the function of gas exchange during fetal development. The ductus aeriosus shunts flow from the left pulmonary aery to the aoa. High oxygen levels after bih and the absence of prostaglandins from the placenta cause the ductus aeriosus to close in most cases within 24 hours.

This term denotes abnormal water retention due to excessive water infusion at a time when there is a high level of ADH in the blood.

Penicillins and their related group of antibiotics were called fl lactam antibiotics because they contained a four carbon ring called fi lactam ring. Within a .few years of introduction of penicillin, bacterias staed acquiring resistance against penicillins by producing penicillinase To overcome this problem penicillinase resistant penicillins came into picture. Sholy afterwards, the broad spectrum penicillin and first gene- ration cephalosporins were introduced. They remained, first line antibiotics. for several years. Over a period of tune bacterias developed resistance even against these organisms by producing filactamase. fi lactamase are enzymes that break open the fi lactam ring and deactivate the antibiotic. The ,B lactamases hydrolyze penicillins and narrow spectrum cephalo- sporin, such as cephalothin or cefazolin, and are resistant to them. To counteract the problems against fl lactamases new classes of /I lactams were developed. These are cephalosporins containing oxy- minio side chain e.g. ceftizoxime, cefotaxine, ceftazidime, ceftriaxone (broad spectrums cephalosporins). - Consequently, when these oxymino side chain containing com- pounds were introduced they were effective against a broad group of otherwise resistant bacterias. - f3luctamases cannot hydrolyze higher generation cephalosporins with an oxymino side chain (cefotaxime, ceftizoxime, ceftazidime). But not long ago after these cephalosporins came into use strains of klebsiella pneumonia were discovered which were resistant even to oxyimino containing cephalosporins e.g. (cefotaxime, cefazidime, ceftriaxone) The mechanism of this resistance was production of extended spectrum /3 lactanzase enzyme (ESBL). These bacterias are called ESBL bacterias -Bacterias are classified as extended spectrum fl lactamase (ESBL) producing bacteria, when a simple point mutation occurs in genes normally responsible .for beta lactamase mediated resistance. The mutation usually responsible is (TEM). - As a result of the mutation, organisms, are able to produce novel beta lactamases that can hydrolyze all the fi lactam containing antibiotics which includes even the ox-pninio group containing cephalosporins (ceftizoxime, cefotaxime, ceftazidime, ceftriaxone), Aztreonam and all the older fi lactam drugs. Because of their greatly extended substrate range these enzymes were called extended spectrum 13 lactamase ESBLS are capable of efficiently hydrolyzing :- -Folic illins - Narrow spectrum cephalosporins - Many extended spectrum cephalosporins - Oxyimino group containing cephalosporins (cefotaxime, ceftazidime) - Monobactams (aztreonams) - Beta lactatnase inhibitors (clavulinic acid sulbactam) An impoant point None of the ESBLS described till to date are able to hydrolyze cephamycin or carbepenems (imipenenz, meropenems) ESBL producing organisms are associated with gram negative bacterias and most of these organisms are in the family. Enterobacteriaeae and has been discovered in almost all members of the enterobacteriaceae family. The enterobacteriacea species most commonly associated with ESBL are klebsiella (Klebsiella pneumonia predominantly) and E. coli. Treatment of ESBL'S Of all the available fllactams \"carbepenenzs\" are the most effective and reliable as they are highly resistant to the hydrolytic activity of the fl lactamase. - None of the ESBLS described till todate are able to hydrolyze cephamycin or Carbepenem (imipenem, meropenem) Meropenem is the most active with MIC generally lower than those of imipenem. Beta lactamase inhibitors (Clavulanic acid, sulbactam, Tazobactam) Although ESBL activity is inhibited by clavulinic acid the only infections that may be treated safely with b lactam / f3lactamase inhibitor combinations are those involving the urinary tract. - In this instance i3lactamase inhibitor concentration is high et,ough to counteract the hydrolytic activity of ESBI:.s clavulinic acid appears more efficient than sulbactam (It takes about eight times more sulbactam to obtain a protection similar to that given by clavulinic acid).

{"question": "What amount of WHO ORS is required for a 1 year old child in first 4 hours of diarrhea?", "exp": "<p>ORS Aim of oral rehydration therapy is to prevent dehydration and reduce moality. Oral fluid therapy is based on the observation that glucose given orally enhances the intestinal absorption of salt and water and is capable of correcting electrolyte and water deficit. At first the composition of oral rehydration salt recommended by WHO was sodium bicarbonate based. Inclusion of trisodium citrate in place of sodium bicarbonate made the product more stable and it resulted in less stool output especially in high output diarrhoea, probably because of direct effect of trisodium citrate in increasing intestinal absorption of sodium and water. More recently an improved ORS formulation has been developed which is safe and effective as the original in preventing and treating diarrhoeal dehydration. It is focussed on reducing the osmolarity of ORS solution to avoid adverse effects of hypeonicity on net fluid absorption by reducing the concentration of glucose and sodium chloride in the solution. A freshly prepared ORS should be used before 24hrs.
