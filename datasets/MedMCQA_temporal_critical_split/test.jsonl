Fractures across the growth plate may produce bony bridges that will cause premature cessation of growth or angular deformities of the extremity. These bridges are due to the trauma to the growth plate and can occur even with adequate reductions.Epiphysial fractures around the shoulder, wrist, and fingers can usually be treated by closed reduction, but fractures of the epiphyses around the elbow often require open reduction. In the lower extremity, accurate reduction of the epiphysial plate is necessary to prevent joint deformity when a joint surface is involved. If angular deformities result, corrective osteotomy may be necessary.Reference: Erickson M.A., Merritt C., Polousky J.D. (2012). Chapter 26. Orthopedics. In W.W. Hay, Jr., M.J. Levin, R.R.

{"question": "A patient with previously normal haemoglobin suffered a sudden massive acute hemorrhage. He is most likely to show all of the following except:", "exp": "Ans. c. High packed cell volume Packed cell volume Packed cell volume (PCV) or hematocrit determines the percentage of red blood cells in the plasma. Decrease in hematocrit PCV in the early hours after acute hemorrhage is usually the result of volume resuscitation rather than ongoing blood loss. The body adjusts to severe hemorrhage by expanding the circulating volume at the expense of extravascular fluid. However, within several hours after hemorrhage plasma volume begins to increase due to shift of interstitial fluid into vascular space RBCs cannot be replaced quickly as the bone marrow takes approximately ten days to produce mature RBCs. As a result PCV done several hours after bleeding episode will show more accurate picture of the hematocrit (Le. decreased PCV). The changes in hematocrit show poor correlation with blood volume deficits and erythrocyte deficits in acute hemorrhage.

Physical examination, including careful cranial nerve and deep tendon reflex testing, is otherwise normal.

This occurs with leakage or rupture of an intracranial aneurysm, usually located at an arterial bifurcation in the anterior cerebral circulation. Rupture may occur spontaneously or at times of exercise. About 2% of persons have \"berry\" aneurysms. Fortunately only a small percentage of these persons ever experience rupture, which may be fatal. The headache that precedes or accompanies SAH is severe and often described as a \"thunderclap\" headache, meaning that it reaches its maximum intensity in seconds. Migraine may also cause severe headache, but usually reaches maximum intensity in 5 to 30 minutes. Syncope occurs in about one-half of patients with SAH and is thought to be due to accompanying cerebral artery spasm Blood in the cerebrospinal fluid irritates the meninges and may cause neck stiffness. Suspected subarachnoid hemorrhage mandates CT scanning as the initial test. In about 90% of patients, there will be enough blood to be visualized on a non contrast CT scan. A contrast CT scan sometimes obscures the diagnosis because, in an enhanced scan, normal arteries may be mistaken for subarachnoid blood. If the CT scan is normal, a lumbar puncture will establish the diagnosis by demonstrating blood in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). As opposed to CSF blood from a traumatic lumbar puncture, the CSF blood does not clear with continued collection of fluid. Cerebral angiography is necessary to assess the need for surgery and to detect other aneurysms, but it is usually delayed because angiography may precipitate spasm, especially if performed immediately after the acute rupture.

(Ref: Kaplan & Sadock's Synopsis of Psychiatry, Xth/Ch. 13, Pg. 476).A 28-year-old female presents with complain of reduced sleep with disorganized behavior since 9 months. She feels there is a camera fixed behind her head, which always follows her. The most likely diagnosis would be Paranoid schizophrenia.Discussion:Depending on the predominance of particular symptoms, four subtypes of schizophrenia are recognized: paranoid, disorganized, catatonic, and residual.The female in the question presents with the classic symptoms of paranoid schizophrenia. This subtype of schizophrenia is characterized by prominent hallucinations and delusional ideations with a relative preservation of affect and cognitive functions. Delusions are usually grandiose or persecutory or both, organized around a central coherent theme. Hallucinations, usually auditory, are frequent and related to the delusional theme. Anxiety, anger, argumentativeness, and aloofness are often present. Paranoid schizophrenia tends to develop later in life and is associated with a better prognosis.Kaplan, pg. 546......Patient with a major depression with psychotic features should have symptoms over two weeks (the minimum for the diagnosis), and symptoms include anhedonia, crying, anergia, decreased concentration, weight loss, and insomnia with early morning awakening. Patient also may have somatic delusions that are mood congruent and an auditory hallucination. The presence of psychotic phenomena that follow a clear mood disorder picture makes the diagnosis of major depression with psychotic features the most likely.Kaplan, pg. 512-520........The main feature of delusional disorder is the presence of one or more nonbizarre delusions without deterioration of psychosocial functioning and in the absence of bizarre or odd behavior. Auditory and visual hallucinations, if present, are not prominent and are related to the delusional theme. Tactile and olfactory hallucinations may also be present if they are incorporated in the delusional system (such as feeling insects crawling over the skin in delusions of infestation). Subtypes of delusional disorder include erotomanic, gran- diose, jealous, persecutory, and somatic (delusions of being infested with parasites, of emitting a bad odor, of having AIDS). Delusional disorder usually manifests in middle or late adult life and has a fluctuating course with periods of remissions and relapses.Additional Educational points:# Amphetamine intoxication can result in a psychosis very closely resembling acute paranoid schizophrenia, with symptoms including paranoid delusions and visual hallucinations.# Persons with a paranoid personality disorder characteristically show marked suspiciousness of others and are extremely sensitive to any potential threat or injustice. They frequently look for hidden motives or meanings, are contemptuous of the weak, and are very sensitive to issues of power and dominance. They often are moralistic or self- righteous and may be quite litigious.

The hair follicle then enters the telogen phase, which is a relatively fixed period of time, approximately 100 days, regardless of the size of the hair follicle. There is no growth of the hair shaft during this phase. It is at the end of the telogen phase that the entire hair shaft, also often referred to as the club hair, will spontaneously shed, while a new hair shaft is forming within the hair canal. The white bulb at the end of the hair, along with the loosely attached collection of friable debris gives the shed hair its characteristic appearance. In the scalp of the healthy, young human adult, approximately 90% of the hair will be in the anagen (growth) phase and approximately 10% will be in the telogen (dormancy) phase.Less than 1% will be in the catagen (transitional) phase.What is Telogen Effluvium??When excessive amounts of hair simultaneously switch from anagen (growth) into telogen (dormancy) and subsequently shed several months later, the phenomenon is referred to as a telogen effluvium.Telogen effluviums can be acute or chronic.What causes Telogen Effluvium?In order to cause a large number of hair follicles to simultaneously switch from the anagen (growing) phase into the telogen (resting) phase, the body has to undergo some systemic insult.A telogen effluvium is not caused by topical medications. But because there is a required time lapse of several months between the inciting cause and the excessive shedding of hair, the exact cause of the telogen effluvium is often not positively identified.A typical and common case of telogen effluvium would be the episode of severe shedding of hair that may occur approximately 100 days after a woman has given birth. The inciting factor is probably the abrupt hormonal changes that occur at the end of pregnancy. All of the hair grows back within a year.Other causes of telogen effluvium include illness,major physicaltrauma,menopause,crash diets,severe psychological stress,major surgery (especially with general anesthesia),hypo- or hyperthyroidism,anemia's,acute and severe blood loss,heavy metal poisoning, etc.Chronic illness such as malignancy, and any chronic debilitating illness,such as systemic lupus erythematosus,end-stage renal disease, - or liver disease can cause telogen effluvium.InfectionsTyphoid, malaria, dengue Anagen effluviumAnagen effluvium is the loss of anagen hair which typically happens after radiation therapy of chemotherapy especially with alkylating agents.", "cop": 2, "opa": "Androgenic alopecia", "opb": "Telogen effuvium", "opc": "Anagen effuvium", "opd": "Alopecia areata", "subject_name": "Skin", "topic_name": "Anatomy of Skin", "id": "d9beac3a-28f7-427c-b04a-7c0aed9ed11f", "choice_type": "single", "idx": 134145, "temporal_analysis": {"is_temporal_critical": true, "temporal_pairs": [{"entity": "hair loss", "duration": "for 1 month"}, {"entity": "enteric fever", "duration": "before 4 months"}], "duration_text": null, "duration_bucket": "months-years", "onset_type": "unknown", "pattern": "none", "temporal_features": ["duration of hair loss", "duration of enteric fever"], "counterfactual_change": "change_answer", "minimal_temporal_edit": null, "reasoning": "The explicit temporal expressions regarding the duration of hair loss and the timing of enteric fever are critical for differentiating potential diagnoses.

Although disease caused by M. pneumoniae can be contracted year-round, thousands of cases occur during the winter months in all age groups. The disease, if untreated, will persist for 2 weeks or longer. Rare but serious side effects include cardiomyopathies and central nervous system complications. Infection with M. pneumoniae may be treated with either erythromycin or tetracycline. The organism lacks a cell wall and so is resistant to the penicillin and the cephalosporin groups of antibiotics. Until recently, diagnostic tests have been of limited value. Up to 50% of cases may not show cold agglutinins, an insensitive and nonspecific acute-phase reactant. However, if cold agglutinins are present, a quick diagnosis can be made if signs and symptoms are characteristic. Complement fixation tests that measure an antibody to a glycolipid antigen of M. pneumoniae are useful but not routinely performed in most laboratories. Also, cross-reactions may occur. Culture of M. pneumoniae, while not technically difficult, may take up to 2 weeks before visible growth is observed. A DNA probe is available. It is an 125I probe for the 16S ribosomal RNA of M. pneumoniae. Evaluations in a number of laboratories indicate that compared with culture it is highly sensitive and specific.

This occurs during the end stages of cirrhosis and is characterized by diminished urine output and low urinary sodium. In the setting of end-stage liver disease, renal vasoconstriction occurs, and the distal convoluted tubule responds by conserving sodium. Unless the renal function is allowed to deteriorate fuher, liver transplantation will reverse this vasoconstriction and kidney function will return to normal.A large volume paracentesis may relieve the ascites but will have no significant benefit on the impaired renal function. There are no indications in this question to suggest that the patient requires acute hemodialysis. A mesocaval shunt is a surgical procedure that may decompress the poal pressure but will not have any benefit on renal function.

{"question": "A female infant is born approximately 10 weeks prematurely (at 30 weeks) and weighs 1710 gm. She has respiratory distress syndrome and is treated with endogenous surfactant. She is intubated endotracheally with mechanical ventilation immediately after bih. Over the first 4 days after bih the ventilator pressure and the fraction of inspired oxygen are reduced. Beginning on the fifth day after bih, she has brief desaturations that become more persistent. She needs increased ventilator and oxygen suppo on the seventh day after bih. She becomes cyanotic. Fuher examination, echocardiogram, and x-rays reveal left atrial enlargement, an enlarged pulmonary aery, increased pulmonary vasculature, and a continuous machine-like murmur. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?", "exp": "Patent ductus aeriosus. The presence of a murmur could be indicative of any of the conditions. The presence of a continuous machine-like murmur is indicative of a patent ductus aeriosus (PDA). Usually, as in this case, the premature baby with PDA does not acutely become cyanotic and ill, although brief desaturations can occur that become more persistent. An atrial septal defect (ASD), such as a persistent foramen ovale, could be eliminated from the diagnosis because the murmur would be heard as an abnormal splitting of the second sound during expiration (answer a). A patent foramen ovale is a common echo finding in premature babies and is usually not followed up unless it appears remarkable to the pediatric cardiologist or there is a persistent murmur. A patent foramen ovale might result in only minimal or intermittent cyanosis during crying or straining to pass stool. A murmur caused by a ventricular septal defect (VSD, answer c), occurs between the first and second hea sounds (S1and S2) and is described as holosystolic (pansystolic) because the amplitude is high throughout systole. Pulmonary stenosis would be heard as a harsh systolic ejection murmur (answer d). PDA refers to the maintenance of the ductus aeriosus, a normal fetal structure. In the fetus, the ductus aeriosus allows blood to bypass the pulmonary circulation, since the lungs are not involved in CO2/O2exchange until after bih. The placenta subserves the function of gas exchange during fetal development. The ductus aeriosus shunts flow from the left pulmonary aery to the aoa. High oxygen levels after bih and the absence of prostaglandins from the placenta cause the ductus aeriosus to close in most cases within 24 hours.

This term denotes abnormal water retention due to excessive water infusion at a time when there is a high level of ADH in the blood.

Penicillins and their related group of antibiotics were called fl lactam antibiotics because they contained a four carbon ring called fi lactam ring. Within a .few years of introduction of penicillin, bacterias staed acquiring resistance against penicillins by producing penicillinase To overcome this problem penicillinase resistant penicillins came into picture. Sholy afterwards, the broad spectrum penicillin and first gene- ration cephalosporins were introduced. They remained, first line antibiotics. for several years. Over a period of tune bacterias developed resistance even against these organisms by producing filactamase. fi lactamase are enzymes that break open the fi lactam ring and deactivate the antibiotic. The ,B lactamases hydrolyze penicillins and narrow spectrum cephalo- sporin, such as cephalothin or cefazolin, and are resistant to them. To counteract the problems against fl lactamases new classes of /I lactams were developed. These are cephalosporins containing oxy- minio side chain e.g. ceftizoxime, cefotaxine, ceftazidime, ceftriaxone (broad spectrums cephalosporins). - Consequently, when these oxymino side chain containing com- pounds were introduced they were effective against a broad group of otherwise resistant bacterias. - f3luctamases cannot hydrolyze higher generation cephalosporins with an oxymino side chain (cefotaxime, ceftizoxime, ceftazidime). But not long ago after these cephalosporins came into use strains of klebsiella pneumonia were discovered which were resistant even to oxyimino containing cephalosporins e.g. (cefotaxime, cefazidime, ceftriaxone) The mechanism of this resistance was production of extended spectrum /3 lactanzase enzyme (ESBL). These bacterias are called ESBL bacterias -Bacterias are classified as extended spectrum fl lactamase (ESBL) producing bacteria, when a simple point mutation occurs in genes normally responsible .for beta lactamase mediated resistance. The mutation usually responsible is (TEM). - As a result of the mutation, organisms, are able to produce novel beta lactamases that can hydrolyze all the fi lactam containing antibiotics which includes even the ox-pninio group containing cephalosporins (ceftizoxime, cefotaxime, ceftazidime, ceftriaxone), Aztreonam and all the older fi lactam drugs. Because of their greatly extended substrate range these enzymes were called extended spectrum 13 lactamase ESBLS are capable of efficiently hydrolyzing :- -Folic illins - Narrow spectrum cephalosporins - Many extended spectrum cephalosporins - Oxyimino group containing cephalosporins (cefotaxime, ceftazidime) - Monobactams (aztreonams) - Beta lactatnase inhibitors (clavulinic acid sulbactam) An impoant point None of the ESBLS described till to date are able to hydrolyze cephamycin or carbepenems (imipenenz, meropenems) ESBL producing organisms are associated with gram negative bacterias and most of these organisms are in the family. Enterobacteriaeae and has been discovered in almost all members of the enterobacteriaceae family. The enterobacteriacea species most commonly associated with ESBL are klebsiella (Klebsiella pneumonia predominantly) and E. coli. Treatment of ESBL'S Of all the available fllactams \"carbepenenzs\" are the most effective and reliable as they are highly resistant to the hydrolytic activity of the fl lactamase. - None of the ESBLS described till todate are able to hydrolyze cephamycin or Carbepenem (imipenem, meropenem) Meropenem is the most active with MIC generally lower than those of imipenem. Beta lactamase inhibitors (Clavulanic acid, sulbactam, Tazobactam) Although ESBL activity is inhibited by clavulinic acid the only infections that may be treated safely with b lactam / f3lactamase inhibitor combinations are those involving the urinary tract. - In this instance i3lactamase inhibitor concentration is high et,ough to counteract the hydrolytic activity of ESBI:.s clavulinic acid appears more efficient than sulbactam (It takes about eight times more sulbactam to obtain a protection similar to that given by clavulinic acid).

{"question": "What amount of WHO ORS is required for a 1 year old child in first 4 hours of diarrhea?", "exp": "<p>ORS Aim of oral rehydration therapy is to prevent dehydration and reduce moality. Oral fluid therapy is based on the observation that glucose given orally enhances the intestinal absorption of salt and water and is capable of correcting electrolyte and water deficit. At first the composition of oral rehydration salt recommended by WHO was sodium bicarbonate based. Inclusion of trisodium citrate in place of sodium bicarbonate made the product more stable and it resulted in less stool output especially in high output diarrhoea, probably because of direct effect of trisodium citrate in increasing intestinal absorption of sodium and water. More recently an improved ORS formulation has been developed which is safe and effective as the original in preventing and treating diarrhoeal dehydration. It is focussed on reducing the osmolarity of ORS solution to avoid adverse effects of hypeonicity on net fluid absorption by reducing the concentration of glucose and sodium chloride in the solution. A freshly prepared ORS should be used before 24hrs.

This increase is typical of anemia of chronic disease. In this case, the chronic disease is rheumatoid arthritis. Underlying chronic inflammatory or neoplastic diseases increases the secretion of cytokines such as interleukin-1, tumor necrosis factor, and interferon-g. These cytokines promote the sequestration of iron in storage compartments and depress erythropoietin production. Autoantibody hemolytic anemias occur in several autoimmune diseases, such as systemic lupus erythematosus, but not usually in patients with rheumatoid arthritis, as in this case. Normal serum haptoglobin rules out intravascular hemolysis; iron is recycled at a rapid rate. Impaired synthesis of b-globin chains gives rise to b-thalassemia, also characterized by hemolysis. Complement lysis is enhanced in paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria, which results from mutations in the PIGA gene. Patients with this disorder have a history of infections. Sequestration of RBCs in the spleen occur when RBC membranes are abnormal, as in hereditary spherocytosis or sickle cell anemia, or RBCs are coated by antibodies, as in autoimmune hemolytic anemias.

(AIIMS November 2013 repeat)Gout is a metabolic disease that most often affects middle- aged to elderly men and postmenopausal women. It results from an increased body pool of urate with hyperuricemia. It typically is characterized by episodic acute and chronic arthritis caused by deposition of MSU crystals in joints and connective tissue tophi and the risk for deposition in kidney interstitium or uric acid nephrolithiasis. Usually, only one joint is affected initially and the metatarsophalangeal joint of the first toe is the most commonly involved joint. '- Harrison 18/e p2837'Radiographic Features of Gout: Early in the disease radiographic studies may only confirm clinically evident swelling. Cystic changes, well-defined erosions with sclerotic margins (often with overhanging bony edges), and soft tissue masses are characteristic features of advanced chronic tophaceous gout. Ultrasound, CT and MRI are being studied and are likely to become more sensitive for early changes. - Harrison 18/e p2837'Tophi appear as characteristic punched-out cysts or deep erosions in the para-articular bone ends. These excavations are larger and slightly further from the joint margin than the typical rheumatoid erosions.

On physical exam, her cervix is firm, posterior, 50% effaced, and 1 cm dilated, and the vertex is at a -1 station. As her obstetrician, which of the following would you recommend to the patient?", "exp": "Post-term or prolonged pregnancies are those pregnancies that have gone beyond 42 completed weeks of gestation. In general, obstetricians do not allow pregnancies to persist after 42 weeks because of the significantly increased incidence of perinatal morbidity and mortality. If a patient has a ripe cervix, it is reasonable to induce the patient at 41 weeks because the chance of having a successful vaginal delivery is very high. On the other hand, if the patient has an unripe cervix, it is generally recommended that she continue with the pregnancy. Alternatively, a patient can be induced at 41 weeks with an unripe cervix if cervical ripening agents are used. If a patient waits until 42 weeks and still has an unripe cervix, then admission with administration of cervical ripening agents prior to Pitocin induction is recommended to improve the likelihood of a successful vaginal delivery. The Bishop score is a way to determine the favorability of the cervix to induction. The elements of the Bishop score include effacement, dilation, station, consistency, and position of the cervix (see table).

The ingested eggs hatch in the duodenum to produce larvae, which cross the small intestinal wall to enter the bloodstream. They then pass through the hea to lodge in the lungs. They leave the lung capillary bed to enter the airspaces. They then ascend the bronchial tree into the oropharynx, where they are again swallowed. This time, they return to the small intestine where they develop into mature worms that can live in the host for up to two years. A gravid female worm may produce up to 250,000 eggs daily, which are shed in stool. The passage of the larvae through the lungs often produces cough and/or wheezing, and may, in severe cases, produce fever, dyspnea, fleeting patchy pulmonary infiltrates (Loeffler pneumonitis with prominent eosinophilia), and rarely hemoptysis. Passage through the hea is usually asymptomatic, as the larvae are small. A single adult worm, but not usually larval forms, can migrate into the biliary tree, leading to biliary colic, cholangitis, or gallstone formation; obstructive jaundice uncommonly occurs.

The disease is autoimmune-mediated and results from autoantibodies to the muscular nicotinic receptors.

Electromyography is therefore very useful in the diagnosis of this condition. Blood, urine, and CSF analysis are entirely within normal limits in myasthenia gravis, although they are indeed frequently performed in the initial screening.\nMRI of the head  and EEG recording would be entirely useless in this setting.

Syndromic causes of Wilms' tumor occur as a result of alterations to genes such as the Wilms Tumor 1 (WT1) or Wilms Tumor 2 (WT2) genes, and the tumor presents with a group of other signs and symptoms. Non-syndromic Wilms' tumor is not associated with other symptoms or pathologies. Many, but not all, cases of Wilms' tumor develop from nephrogenic rests, which are fragments of tissue in or around the kidney that develop before bih and become cancerous after bih. In paicular, cases of bilateral Wilms' tumor, as well as cases of Wilms' tumor derived from ceain genetic syndromes such as Denys-Drash syndrome, are strongly associated with nephrogenic rests. Most nephroblastomas are on one side of the body only and are found on both sides in less than 5% of cases, although people with Denys-Drash syndrome mostly have bilateral or multiple tumors. They tend to be encapsulated and vascularized tumors that do not cross the midline of the abdomen. In cases of metastasis it is usually to the lung. A rupture of Wilms' tumor puts the patient at risk of bleeding and peritoneal dissemination of the tumor. In such cases, surgical intervention by a surgeon who is experienced in the removal of such a fragile tumor is imperative. Pathologically, a triphasic nephroblastoma comprises three elements: blastema mesenchyme (stroma) epithelium Wilms' tumor is a malignant tumor containing metanephric blastema, stromal and epithelial derivatives. Characteristic is the presence of aboive tubules and glomeruli surrounded by a spindled cell stroma. The stroma may include striated muscle, cailage, bone, fat tissue, and fibrous tissue. Dysfunction is caused when the tumor compresses the normal kidney parenchyma. The mesenchymal component may include cells showing rhabdomyoid differentiation or malignancy (rhabdomyosarcomatous Wilms). Wilms' tumors may be separated into 2 prognostic groups based on pathologic characteristics: Favorable - Contains well developed components mentioned above Anaplastic - Contains diffuse anaplasia (poorly developed cells) Mutations of the WT1 gene on chromosome 11p13 are observed in approximately 20% of Wilms' tumors.At least half of the Wilms' tumors with mutations in WT1 also carry mutations in CTNNB1, the gene encoding the proto-oncogene beta-catenin Typical signs and symptoms of Wilms' tumor include the following: a painless, palpable abdominal mass loss of appetite abdominal pain fever nausea and vomiting blood in the urine (in about 20% of cases) high blood pressure in some cases (especially if synchronous or metachronous bilateral kidney involvement) Rarely as varicocele Ref Harrison20th edition pg 277", "cop": 1, "opa": "Wilm's tumour", "opb": "IgA nephropathy", "opc": "Post-strepcoccal glomerulonephritis", "opd": "Urinary tract Infection", "subject_name": "Medicine", "topic_name": "Kidney", "id": "b2259878-c7b8-454e-b491-59ece2ea4ba4", "choice_type": "single", "idx": 169283, "temporal_analysis": {"is_temporal_critical": true, "temporal_pairs": [{"entity": "gross hematuria", "duration": "for 2 years"}], "duration_text": "for 2 years", "duration_bucket": "months-years", "onset_type": "unknown", "pattern": "recurrent", "temporal_features": ["duration"], "counterfactual_change": "change_answer", "minimal_temporal_edit": null, "reasoning": "The duration of gross hematuria for 2 years is critical in differentiating potential diagnoses such as IgA nephropathy or other chronic renal conditions from acute causes.

Hydrocephalus may result if the subarachnoid bleeding or subsequent fibrosis create obstructions to CSF flow through the subarachnoid space or drainage of the CSF. Epidural bleeding results in most cases from tearing of the middle meningeal artery, and this rapidly expanding, space-occupying lesion can cause death within 12 hours. Intracerebral bleeding into the brain parenchyma is focal bleeding from a blood vessel into the brain parenchyma, most likely caused by hypertension and/or atherosclerosis.

The syndrome can vary greatly in presentation and nerve involvement. Brachial neuritis (BN) exists in an inherited and an idiopathic form. In the idiopathic version, the pathophysiology is unknown, but the condition is generally thought to be an immune system - mediated inflammatory reaction against nerve fibers of the brachial plexus. The onset of pain in brachial neuritis (BN) is often abrupt and may follow recent illness, surgery, immunization, or even trauma (see Causes, below). Up to two thirds of cases begin during the nighttime. Sensory abnormalities are of usually of less intensity than the pain and muscle weakness. Causes: The exact cause of brachial neuritis is unknown, but the condition has been linked to many antecedent events or illnesses, as follows: Viral infection (paicularly of the upper respiratory tract) Bacterial infection (eg, pneumonia, diphtheria, typhoid) Parasitic infestation S urgery 2 Trauma (not related to shoulder) Vaccinations (eg, influenza, tetanus, diphtheria, tetanus toxoids, peussis [DPT J. smallpox, swine flu) Childbih Miscellaneous medical investigative procedures (eg, lumbar puncture, administration of radiologic dye) Systemic illness (eg, polyaeritis nodosa, lymphoma, systemic lupus erythematosus, temporal aeritis, EhlersDanlos syndrome) A rarer, hereditary form of BN has been localized to the SEPT9 gene on chromosome arm 17q and should be considered a distinct disorder. This entity presents in a younger age group, and is characterized by recurrent, often bilateral attacks. Dysmorphic facial features (eg, hypotelorism, long nasal bridge, facial asymmetry) can also be present. Diagnosis: Other causes of severe pain, such as an acute herniated cervical disc, should be excluded. In brachial plexus neuritis, electromyography and nerve conduction studies reveal abnormalities in more than one nerve; in contrast, cervical radiculopathy may show osteophytes and interspace narrowing on cervical spine x-rays and neuroforaminal disc impingement of MRI.

{"question": "A 65-year-old man undergoes a technically difficult abdominal-perineal resection for a rectal cancer during which he receives 3 units of packed red blood cells. Four hours later, in the intensive care unit (ICU), he is bleeding heavily from his perineal wound. Emergency coagulation studies reveal normal prothrombin, paial thromboplastin, and bleeding times.

Blood transfusion reactions can cause diffuse loss of clot integrity; the sudden appearance of diffuse bleeding during an operation may be the only evidence of an intraoperative transfusion reaction. In the postoperative period, transfusion reactions usually present as unexplained fever, apprehension, and headache--all symptoms difficult to interpret in the early postoperative period. Factor VIII deficiency (hemophilia) would almost ceainly be known by history in a 65-year-old man, but, if not, intraoperative bleeding would have been a problem earlier in this long operation. Moreover, factor VIII deficiency causes prolongation of the paial thromboplastin time (PTT), which is normal in this patient.

Bile leakage presents themselves in the postoperative period by pain and fever, with or without abnormal liver function tests and jaundice. Other manifestations include external discharge of bile through the drain or surgical incision or biliary peritonitis or biloma or cholangitis. Initial investigation of these patients includes U/S or CT (preferably CT) for detection of any fluid collection. Any biliary collection or subhepatic abscess should be promptly drained. Minor collection, after percutaneous drainage, needs no fuher treatment, if the patient improves. However, in the presence of any major leak, jaundice, signs of cholangitis, the patient should be investigated with an ERC (or PTC) to establish the presence, extent and severity of bile duct injury. Management of Cystic duct bile leaks are usually due to slipping of ligature or clip. can be managed by endoscopic sphincterotomy and stenting (the principle behind is that if the bile is allowed to flow through the normal tract, any fistulous communication would heal spontaneously) The above mentioned management of cystic duct leak is given in Sabiston; Blumga's Surgery of the liver and biliary tract; Textbook of Liver & biliary, surgery by William C Meyer and in Maingot's abdominal operations.

Biopsy of the responsible lesion shows a whorling pattern of the cells. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?", "exp": "The most likely diagnosis is an intracranial meningioma. Meningiomas are slow-growing, benign tumors comprising 15% of intracranial tumors; they are most common in the elderly. They originate from either dura mater or arachnoid and are sharply demarcated from brain tissue. Meningiomas often incite an osteoblastic reaction in the overlying cranial bones. Microscopically, the meningioma cells have a tendency to encircle one another, forming whorls and psammoma bodies. Clinically, they present as mass lesions; seizures may occur. The superior parasagittal surface of the frontal lobes is a orite site of origin. This can often produce leg weakness, since the leg motor fibers that pass down through the internal capsule originate in parasagittal coical regions. Treatment of meningiomas is usually surgical. Arachnoid cysts are formed by splitting of the arachnoid membrane; most arachnoid cysts arise near the Syln fissure. They may present with mass effect, but would be unlikely to produce seizures, prominent focal signs, or reactive hyperostosis. Glioblastoma multiforme is an aggressive malignant astrocytoma that would likely have killed the patient long before 5 years had elapsed. Metastatic breast cancer would generally look different microscopically (the whorling cell pattern is characteristic of meningioma). It would be unlikely for metastatic cancer to cause a reaction in the overlying bone, or to be present long enough to cause symptoms for 5 years. Ref: Johnson J., Lalwani A.K. (2012). Chapter 62.

{"question": "An eye surgery was performed using propofol as the intravenous anesthetic agent and succinylcholine as the muscle relaxant. Recovery from anesthesia was uneventful. However, after 8 hours of surgery, patient complained of pain in legs on walking. Which of the following is the most likely reason for this?", "exp": "Ans. b. Succinylcholine (Ref: Miller's Anesthesia 8/e p866; Morgan 4/e p210-215; Lee 13/e p181-191)Succinylcholine is a short acting depolarizing muscle relaxant, which causes initial fasciculations during induction. It can cause muscle soreness and post-op muscle pain.Succinylcholine (Scoline, Suxamethonium or Diacetylcholine)Suxamethonium chloride, a dicholine ester of acetyl cholineA clear, colorless aqueous solution of pH 3.0-5.0 with a shelf life of 2 yearsQStored at 4degCQSpontaneous hydrolysis occurs in alkaline or warm conditionsQ.Metabolism:Sch is the only depolarizing (non-competitive) muscle relaxantQ in clinical use.It is the only neuromuscular blocker with a rapid onset of action (30-60 seconds) and ultra short (shortest) duration of actionQ (3-5 min; typically < 10 min).Its rapid onset effect is mainly due to its low lipid solubilityQ and relatively overdose that is administered.The short duration of action is due to rapid hydrolysis by butyrylcholinesterase (plasma cholinesterase or pseudocholinesteraseQ).Dibucaine number indicates the percentage of inhibition of pseudocholinesteraseQ (butyrylcholinesterase) enzyme activity by local anesthetic dibucaine and it is a measure of qualitative activity of pseudocholinesterase.The dibucaine number indicates the genetic make up of an individual with respect to butyrylcholinesterase. it does not measure the concentration of enzyme in plasma, nor does it indicate the efficiency of enzyme in hydrolysing substrate succinylcholine or mivacuriumQ.Dibucaine number is proportional to enzyme function (quality) and independent of amount of enzyme (i.e. quantity)Q.Prolonged paralysis from succinylcholine caused by atypical (abnormal) pseudochoiinesterase should be treated with continued mechanical ventilation until muscle fasciculation returns to normalQ. Anticholinesterases neostigmine and pyridostigmine are avoidedQ, as these may prolong the effect of Sch.Side Effects:Sch is a relatively safe drug but because of risk of hyperkalemia, rhabdomyolysis and cardiac arrest (profound bradycardia) in children with undiagnosed myopathies, Sch is considered contraindicated in routine management of children and adolescent.Side effects of Succinylcholine include an increase in* Muscle tone (masseter spasm)Q* Muscle fasciculations (signal onset of paralysis)Q* Muscle pains or myalgia (MC complication)Q* Hyperkalemia leading to diastolic cardiac arrest refractory to CPRQ* Introcutar, intracranial, intra abdominal, intragastric pressure and opening pressure of lower esophageal sphincter (all increased)* Malignant hyperthermiaQManagement of Side-effects:Sinus bradycardias, nodal (junctional rhythms and ventricular dysrhythmiasQ occur. Children are particularly susceptible to profound bradycardia. Intravenous atropine is prophylactically, given to children prior to first dose and always before a 2nd dose.Side effects especially myalgia and fasciculation can be prevented by precurarization, self-taming with IV scoline, IV lignocaine and faster infusion.

Most of the serological tests used in the diagnosis of syphilis cannot accurately diagnosis neurosyphilis. Hence, the diagnosis of neurosyphilis usually depends on combination of clinical features plus C.S.F. finding and serological tests. C.S.F. findings in syphilis:? - Lymphocytic pleocytosis - Protein is moderately elevated - Glucose is usually normal Among the serological tests - \"The VDRL C.S.F. test is the standard serological test for and is considered diagnostic of neurosyphilis\". - Since invasion of C.S.F. by syphilis stimulates production of antilipoidal antibodies in C.S.F., VDRL test can be performed on C.S.F. to diagnose neurosyphilis. - The VDRL test is highly specific albeit insensitive for the diagnosis of neurosyphilis. - The sensitivity of VDRL for neurosyphilis is 30% and specificity is 90%. Specific treponemol tests have proved to be quite inaccurate in the diagnosis of neurosyphilis Why ??? - The antibodies against the specific treponemal antigen have the tendency to cross C.S.F., so enough antibodies may be present in the C.S.F. even before neurosyphilis develops. - Therefore specific treponemal tests have no specificity for neurosyphilis.

This means that there is less bicarbonate in his blood than usual. If his breathing is normal, then his CO2 level should be about normal. Bicarbonate is produced when CO2 binds to an H2O molecule, which then splits into a H+ ion and a HCO3- (bicarbonate) ion. This reaction is governed by an equilibrium constant propoional to the concentrations of the products multiplied together over the concentrations of the reactants multiplied together. By convention, the \"water\" concentration is ignored because it is \"constant.\" So, in order for the equilibrium constant to not change value, the H+ concentration must increase if the bicarbonate decreases and the CO2 remains the same. This means that an acidosis is produced. In this case, it is a metabolic acidosis, since there is no indication of respiratory disease in this patient.

Aspiration of the metatarsal-phalangeal joint of the affected toe demonstrates needle-shaped negatively birefringent crystals. Which of the following agents would provide the most immediate relief for this patient?", "exp": "The patient has gout, which is due to precipitation of monosodium urate crystals in joint spaces (notably the great toe) and soft tissues (causing tophi, which are often found on the external ears). Colchicine reduces the inflammation caused by the urate crystals by inhibiting leukocyte migration and phagocytosis secondary to an effect on microtubule assembly. Allopurinol and its metabolite, oxypurinol, inhibit xanthine oxidase, the enzyme that forms uric acid from hypoxanthine. Therapy with this agent should be begun 1-2 weeks after the acute attack has subsided. Aspirin competes with uric acid for tubular secretion, thereby decreasing urinary urate excretion and raising serum uric acid levels. At high doses (more than 2 gm daily) aspirin is a uricosuric. Probenecid and sulfinpyrazone are uricosuric agents, increasing the urinary excretion of uric acid, hence decreasing serum levels of the substance.

Malignant otitis externa is a disorder involving inflammation and damage of the bones and cartilage at the base of skull in temporal bone as a result of spread of infection from outer ear.* Malignant otitis externa is often caused by difficult to treat bacteria such as pseudomonas aeruginosa. Only rare cases of malignant otitis externa due to S. aureus, Proteus mirabilis and Aspergillus fumigatus have been reported. The infection spreads from the floor of the ear canal to the nearby tissues and into the bones at the base of the skull. The infection and inflammation may damage or destroy the bones. The infection may spread more and affect the cranial nerves, brain, or other parts of the body.Predisposing factors for malignant otitis externa* Elderly diabetics (most common predisposing factor)* Individuals with altered immune function (immunodeficiency)* ChemotherapyClinical features of malignant otitis externa* Severe pain inside the ear and may get worse when moving head.* Granulation tissue in the external auditory canal, at the junction of bony and cartilagenous part.* Drainage from the ear - yellow, yellow - green, foul smelling, persistent.* Fever* Itching of ear or ear canal* Troubled swallowing & weakness of face.Complications* Cranial nerve palsies most commonly facial nerve is involved. Other cranial nerves can also be involved (glossopharyngeal, vagus, spinal accessory, hypoglossal, abducens, trigeminal).* Jugular venous thrombosis* Cavernous sinus thrombosis* MeningitisTreatment of malignant otitis externa* In all cases, the external ear canal is cleansed and a biopsy specimen of the granulation tissue sent for culture.* IV antibiotics is directed against the offending organism. For Pseudomonas aeruginosa, the most common pathogen, the regimen involves an antipseudomonal penicillin or cephalosporin (3rd generation piperacillin or ceftazidime) with an aminoglycoside.* A fluoroquinolone antibiotic can be used in place of the aminoglycoside.* Ear drops containing antipseudomonal antibiotic e.g. ciproflaxacin plus a glucocorticoid is also used.* Early cases can be managed with oral and otic fluoroquinolones only.* Extensive surgical debridement once an important part of the treatment is now rarely needed.Radiology in malignant otitis externa* To look for signs of a bone infection next to the ear canal, the following tests may be performedi) CT scan of the head# A CT scan defines the anatomical extent of the disease and remains the initial investigation of choice.ii) MRI of the head# MRI scanning is useful for asessing the initial severity of the disease and is excellent at delineating the extent of soft tissue disease present and intracranial complications.iii) Radioisotope scans (technetium 99/gallium 67)# A base line gallium scan is obtained for comparison followed by serial scans to monitor treatment response.# Radioactive labelled white cell scans have a role in assessing the presence and degree of osteomyelitis.", "cop": 2, "opa": "Serous otitis media", "opb": "Malignant otitis externa", "opc": "Carcinoma of external auditory canal", "opd": "Otitis media", "subject_name": "ENT", "topic_name": "Ear", "id": "89fb5fbd-4018-40be-abbe-edc34d7b3630", "choice_type": "single", "idx": 145649, "temporal_analysis": {"is_temporal_critical": true, "temporal_pairs": [{"entity": "pus discharge", "duration": "since three days"}], "duration_text": "since three days", "duration_bucket": "days", "onset_type": "unknown", "pattern": "none", "temporal_features": ["duration"], "counterfactual_change": "change_answer", "minimal_temporal_edit": null, "reasoning": "The duration of 'since three days' is critical as it helps differentiate between acute and chronic conditions.
