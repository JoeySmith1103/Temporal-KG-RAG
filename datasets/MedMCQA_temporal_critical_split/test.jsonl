This increase is typical of anemia of chronic disease. In this case, the chronic disease is rheumatoid arthritis. Underlying chronic inflammatory or neoplastic diseases increases the secretion of cytokines such as interleukin-1, tumor necrosis factor, and interferon-g. These cytokines promote the sequestration of iron in storage compartments and depress erythropoietin production. Autoantibody hemolytic anemias occur in several autoimmune diseases, such as systemic lupus erythematosus, but not usually in patients with rheumatoid arthritis, as in this case. Normal serum haptoglobin rules out intravascular hemolysis; iron is recycled at a rapid rate. Impaired synthesis of b-globin chains gives rise to b-thalassemia, also characterized by hemolysis. Complement lysis is enhanced in paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria, which results from mutations in the PIGA gene. Patients with this disorder have a history of infections. Sequestration of RBCs in the spleen occur when RBC membranes are abnormal, as in hereditary spherocytosis or sickle cell anemia, or RBCs are coated by antibodies, as in autoimmune hemolytic anemias.

(AIIMS November 2013 repeat)Gout is a metabolic disease that most often affects middle- aged to elderly men and postmenopausal women. It results from an increased body pool of urate with hyperuricemia. It typically is characterized by episodic acute and chronic arthritis caused by deposition of MSU crystals in joints and connective tissue tophi and the risk for deposition in kidney interstitium or uric acid nephrolithiasis. Usually, only one joint is affected initially and the metatarsophalangeal joint of the first toe is the most commonly involved joint. '- Harrison 18/e p2837'Radiographic Features of Gout: Early in the disease radiographic studies may only confirm clinically evident swelling. Cystic changes, well-defined erosions with sclerotic margins (often with overhanging bony edges), and soft tissue masses are characteristic features of advanced chronic tophaceous gout. Ultrasound, CT and MRI are being studied and are likely to become more sensitive for early changes. - Harrison 18/e p2837'Tophi appear as characteristic punched-out cysts or deep erosions in the para-articular bone ends. These excavations are larger and slightly further from the joint margin than the typical rheumatoid erosions.

N. and causes its palsy, whereas an aneurysm of intracavernous part of the carotid artery compresses III & VI cranial nerves.The first point of the clinical features of SAH need a little more explanation.Although sudden headache in the absence of focal neurological symptoms is the hallmark of aneurysmal rupture, focal neurologic deficits may occur.Anterior communicating artery or middle cerebral bifurcation aneurysms may rupture into the adjacent brain or subdural space and form a hematoma large enough to produce mass effect.The common deficits that result include hemiparesis, aphasia and abulia (inability to exercise will power, lack of impulse to activity, a mental and physical slowness).Clinical features of Hypertensive HaemorrhageHemorrhage generally presents as abrupt onset of focal neurological deficit (according to the area involved)Focal neurological deficit gradually worsens and is accompanied by signs of increased intra cranial pressure (ICP) such as headache and vomiting.In hypertensive bleeding the hemorrhage is intracerebral.Arteriovenous malformation HaemorrhageAlthough AVM can cause SAH but they are a rare cause.AVMs cause intra parenchymal Haemorrhage rarely spilling into the subarachnoid space.Its Haemorrhage, therefore causes focal neurological deficit according to the part involved.", "cop": 3, "opa": "Hypertensive brain haemorrhage", "opb": "Migraine", "opc": "Aneurysmal subarachnoid haemorrhage", "opd": "Arteriovenous malformation haemorrhage", "subject_name": "Medicine", "topic_name": "Cerebrovascular", "id": "c6cbeac5-bddf-4f44-8855-c1424ab6e900", "choice_type": "single", "idx": 157780, "temporal_analysis": {"is_temporal_critical": true, "temporal_pairs": [{"entity": "severe headache", "duration": "two hours"}], "duration_text": "two hours", "duration_bucket": "minutes-hours", "onset_type": "sudden", "pattern": "none", "temporal_features": ["sudden onset", "duration of two hours"], "counterfactual_change": "change_answer", "minimal_temporal_edit": null, "reasoning": "The explicit temporal information regarding the duration of the headache (two hours) and its sudden onset is critical for differentiating between potential diagnoses such as subarachnoid hemorrhage and other causes of headache.

The patient reports good fetal movement; she has been doing kick counts for the past several days and reports that the baby moves about eight times an hour on average. On physical exam, her cervix is firm, posterior, 50% effaced, and 1 cm dilated, and the vertex is at a -1 station. As her obstetrician, which of the following would you recommend to the patient?", "exp": "Post-term or prolonged pregnancies are those pregnancies that have gone beyond 42 completed weeks of gestation. In general, obstetricians do not allow pregnancies to persist after 42 weeks because of the significantly increased incidence of perinatal morbidity and mortality. If a patient has a ripe cervix, it is reasonable to induce the patient at 41 weeks because the chance of having a successful vaginal delivery is very high. On the other hand, if the patient has an unripe cervix, it is generally recommended that she continue with the pregnancy. Alternatively, a patient can be induced at 41 weeks with an unripe cervix if cervical ripening agents are used. If a patient waits until 42 weeks and still has an unripe cervix, then admission with administration of cervical ripening agents prior to Pitocin induction is recommended to improve the likelihood of a successful vaginal delivery. The Bishop score is a way to determine the favorability of the cervix to induction. The elements of the Bishop score include effacement, dilation, station, consistency, and position of the cervix (see table). Induction to active labor is usually successful with a Bishop score of 9 or greater. In the scenario described here, the patient has a Bishop score of 4, which is unfavorable for induction. Therefore, expectant management is a reasonable management plan to try to give the cervix time to ripen to avoid a cesarean section.

The ingested eggs hatch in the duodenum to produce larvae, which cross the small intestinal wall to enter the bloodstream. They then pass through the hea to lodge in the lungs. They leave the lung capillary bed to enter the airspaces. They then ascend the bronchial tree into the oropharynx, where they are again swallowed. This time, they return to the small intestine where they develop into mature worms that can live in the host for up to two years. A gravid female worm may produce up to 250,000 eggs daily, which are shed in stool. The passage of the larvae through the lungs often produces cough and/or wheezing, and may, in severe cases, produce fever, dyspnea, fleeting patchy pulmonary infiltrates (Loeffler pneumonitis with prominent eosinophilia), and rarely hemoptysis. Passage through the hea is usually asymptomatic, as the larvae are small.

Syndromic causes of Wilms' tumor occur as a result of alterations to genes such as the Wilms Tumor 1 (WT1) or Wilms Tumor 2 (WT2) genes, and the tumor presents with a group of other signs and symptoms. Non-syndromic Wilms' tumor is not associated with other symptoms or pathologies. Many, but not all, cases of Wilms' tumor develop from nephrogenic rests, which are fragments of tissue in or around the kidney that develop before bih and become cancerous after bih. In paicular, cases of bilateral Wilms' tumor, as well as cases of Wilms' tumor derived from ceain genetic syndromes such as Denys-Drash syndrome, are strongly associated with nephrogenic rests. Most nephroblastomas are on one side of the body only and are found on both sides in less than 5% of cases, although people with Denys-Drash syndrome mostly have bilateral or multiple tumors. They tend to be encapsulated and vascularized tumors that do not cross the midline of the abdomen. In cases of metastasis it is usually to the lung. A rupture of Wilms' tumor puts the patient at risk of bleeding and peritoneal dissemination of the tumor. In such cases, surgical intervention by a surgeon who is experienced in the removal of such a fragile tumor is imperative. Pathologically, a triphasic nephroblastoma comprises three elements: blastema mesenchyme (stroma) epithelium Wilms' tumor is a malignant tumor containing metanephric blastema, stromal and epithelial derivatives. Characteristic is the presence of aboive tubules and glomeruli surrounded by a spindled cell stroma. The stroma may include striated muscle, cailage, bone, fat tissue, and fibrous tissue. Dysfunction is caused when the tumor compresses the normal kidney parenchyma. The mesenchymal component may include cells showing rhabdomyoid differentiation or malignancy (rhabdomyosarcomatous Wilms). Wilms' tumors may be separated into 2 prognostic groups based on pathologic characteristics: Favorable - Contains well developed components mentioned above Anaplastic - Contains diffuse anaplasia (poorly developed cells) Mutations of the WT1 gene on chromosome 11p13 are observed in approximately 20% of Wilms' tumors.At least half of the Wilms' tumors with mutations in WT1 also carry mutations in CTNNB1, the gene encoding the proto-oncogene beta-catenin Typical signs and symptoms of Wilms' tumor include the following: a painless, palpable abdominal mass loss of appetite abdominal pain fever nausea and vomiting blood in the urine (in about 20% of cases) high blood pressure in some cases (especially if synchronous or metachronous bilateral kidney involvement) Rarely as varicocele Ref Harrison20th edition pg 277", "cop": 1, "opa": "Wilm's tumour", "opb": "IgA nephropathy", "opc": "Post-strepcoccal glomerulonephritis", "opd": "Urinary tract Infection", "subject_name": "Medicine", "topic_name": "Kidney", "id": "b2259878-c7b8-454e-b491-59ece2ea4ba4", "choice_type": "single", "idx": 169283, "temporal_analysis": {"is_temporal_critical": true, "temporal_pairs": [{"entity": "gross hematuria", "duration": "for 2 years"}], "duration_text": "for 2 years", "duration_bucket": "months-years", "onset_type": "unknown", "pattern": "recurrent", "temporal_features": ["duration"], "counterfactual_change": "change_answer", "minimal_temporal_edit": null, "reasoning": "The duration of gross hematuria for 2 years is critical in differentiating potential diagnoses such as IgA nephropathy or other chronic renal conditions from acute causes.

Hydrocephalus may result if the subarachnoid bleeding or subsequent fibrosis create obstructions to CSF flow through the subarachnoid space or drainage of the CSF. Epidural bleeding results in most cases from tearing of the middle meningeal artery, and this rapidly expanding, space-occupying lesion can cause death within 12 hours. Intracerebral bleeding into the brain parenchyma is focal bleeding from a blood vessel into the brain parenchyma, most likely caused by hypertension and/or atherosclerosis.

The syndrome can vary greatly in presentation and nerve involvement. Brachial neuritis (BN) exists in an inherited and an idiopathic form. In the idiopathic version, the pathophysiology is unknown, but the condition is generally thought to be an immune system - mediated inflammatory reaction against nerve fibers of the brachial plexus. The onset of pain in brachial neuritis (BN) is often abrupt and may follow recent illness, surgery, immunization, or even trauma (see Causes, below). Up to two thirds of cases begin during the nighttime. Sensory abnormalities are of usually of less intensity than the pain and muscle weakness. Causes: The exact cause of brachial neuritis is unknown, but the condition has been linked to many antecedent events or illnesses, as follows: Viral infection (paicularly of the upper respiratory tract) Bacterial infection (eg, pneumonia, diphtheria, typhoid) Parasitic infestation S urgery 2 Trauma (not related to shoulder) Vaccinations (eg, influenza, tetanus, diphtheria, tetanus toxoids, peussis [DPT J. smallpox, swine flu) Childbih Miscellaneous medical investigative procedures (eg, lumbar puncture, administration of radiologic dye) Systemic illness (eg, polyaeritis nodosa, lymphoma, systemic lupus erythematosus, temporal aeritis, EhlersDanlos syndrome) A rarer, hereditary form of BN has been localized to the SEPT9 gene on chromosome arm 17q and should be considered a distinct disorder. This entity presents in a younger age group, and is characterized by recurrent, often bilateral attacks. Dysmorphic facial features (eg, hypotelorism, long nasal bridge, facial asymmetry) can also be present. Diagnosis: Other causes of severe pain, such as an acute herniated cervical disc, should be excluded. In brachial plexus neuritis, electromyography and nerve conduction studies reveal abnormalities in more than one nerve; in contrast, cervical radiculopathy may show osteophytes and interspace narrowing on cervical spine x-rays and neuroforaminal disc impingement of MRI.

Bile leakage presents themselves in the postoperative period by pain and fever, with or without abnormal liver function tests and jaundice. Other manifestations include external discharge of bile through the drain or surgical incision or biliary peritonitis or biloma or cholangitis. Initial investigation of these patients includes U/S or CT (preferably CT) for detection of any fluid collection. Any biliary collection or subhepatic abscess should be promptly drained. Minor collection, after percutaneous drainage, needs no fuher treatment, if the patient improves.

Meningiomas are slow-growing, benign tumors comprising 15% of intracranial tumors; they are most common in the elderly. They originate from either dura mater or arachnoid and are sharply demarcated from brain tissue. Meningiomas often incite an osteoblastic reaction in the overlying cranial bones. Microscopically, the meningioma cells have a tendency to encircle one another, forming whorls and psammoma bodies. Clinically, they present as mass lesions; seizures may occur. The superior parasagittal surface of the frontal lobes is a orite site of origin. This can often produce leg weakness, since the leg motor fibers that pass down through the internal capsule originate in parasagittal coical regions. Treatment of meningiomas is usually surgical. Arachnoid cysts are formed by splitting of the arachnoid membrane; most arachnoid cysts arise near the Syln fissure. They may present with mass effect, but would be unlikely to produce seizures, prominent focal signs, or reactive hyperostosis. Glioblastoma multiforme is an aggressive malignant astrocytoma that would likely have killed the patient long before 5 years had elapsed. Metastatic breast cancer would generally look different microscopically (the whorling cell pattern is characteristic of meningioma). It would be unlikely for metastatic cancer to cause a reaction in the overlying bone, or to be present long enough to cause symptoms for 5 years. Ref: Johnson J., Lalwani A.K. (2012). Chapter 62.

However, after 8 hours of surgery, patient complained of pain in legs on walking. Which of the following is the most likely reason for this?", "exp": "Ans. b. Succinylcholine (Ref: Miller's Anesthesia 8/e p866; Morgan 4/e p210-215; Lee 13/e p181-191)Succinylcholine is a short acting depolarizing muscle relaxant, which causes initial fasciculations during induction. It can cause muscle soreness and post-op muscle pain.Succinylcholine (Scoline, Suxamethonium or Diacetylcholine)Suxamethonium chloride, a dicholine ester of acetyl cholineA clear, colorless aqueous solution of pH 3.0-5.0 with a shelf life of 2 yearsQStored at 4degCQSpontaneous hydrolysis occurs in alkaline or warm conditionsQ.Metabolism:Sch is the only depolarizing (non-competitive) muscle relaxantQ in clinical use.It is the only neuromuscular blocker with a rapid onset of action (30-60 seconds) and ultra short (shortest) duration of actionQ (3-5 min; typically < 10 min).Its rapid onset effect is mainly due to its low lipid solubilityQ and relatively overdose that is administered.The short duration of action is due to rapid hydrolysis by butyrylcholinesterase (plasma cholinesterase or pseudocholinesteraseQ).Dibucaine number indicates the percentage of inhibition of pseudocholinesteraseQ (butyrylcholinesterase) enzyme activity by local anesthetic dibucaine and it is a measure of qualitative activity of pseudocholinesterase.The dibucaine number indicates the genetic make up of an individual with respect to butyrylcholinesterase. it does not measure the concentration of enzyme in plasma, nor does it indicate the efficiency of enzyme in hydrolysing substrate succinylcholine or mivacuriumQ.Dibucaine number is proportional to enzyme function (quality) and independent of amount of enzyme (i.e. quantity)Q.Prolonged paralysis from succinylcholine caused by atypical (abnormal) pseudochoiinesterase should be treated with continued mechanical ventilation until muscle fasciculation returns to normalQ. Anticholinesterases neostigmine and pyridostigmine are avoidedQ, as these may prolong the effect of Sch.Side Effects:Sch is a relatively safe drug but because of risk of hyperkalemia, rhabdomyolysis and cardiac arrest (profound bradycardia) in children with undiagnosed myopathies, Sch is considered contraindicated in routine management of children and adolescent.Side effects of Succinylcholine include an increase in* Muscle tone (masseter spasm)Q* Muscle fasciculations (signal onset of paralysis)Q* Muscle pains or myalgia (MC complication)Q* Hyperkalemia leading to diastolic cardiac arrest refractory to CPRQ* Introcutar, intracranial, intra abdominal, intragastric pressure and opening pressure of lower esophageal sphincter (all increased)* Malignant hyperthermiaQManagement of Side-effects:Sinus bradycardias, nodal (junctional rhythms and ventricular dysrhythmiasQ occur. Children are particularly susceptible to profound bradycardia. Intravenous atropine is prophylactically, given to children prior to first dose and always before a 2nd dose.Side effects especially myalgia and fasciculation can be prevented by precurarization, self-taming with IV scoline, IV lignocaine and faster infusion.

Most of the serological tests used in the diagnosis of syphilis cannot accurately diagnosis neurosyphilis. Hence, the diagnosis of neurosyphilis usually depends on combination of clinical features plus C.S.F. finding and serological tests. C.S.F. findings in syphilis:? - Lymphocytic pleocytosis - Protein is moderately elevated - Glucose is usually normal Among the serological tests - \"The VDRL C.S.F. test is the standard serological test for and is considered diagnostic of neurosyphilis\". - Since invasion of C.S.F. by syphilis stimulates production of antilipoidal antibodies in C.S.F., VDRL test can be performed on C.S.F. to diagnose neurosyphilis. - The VDRL test is highly specific albeit insensitive for the diagnosis of neurosyphilis. - The sensitivity of VDRL for neurosyphilis is 30% and specificity is 90%. Specific treponemol tests have proved to be quite inaccurate in the diagnosis of neurosyphilis Why ??? - The antibodies against the specific treponemal antigen have the tendency to cross C.S.F., so enough antibodies may be present in the C.S.F. even before neurosyphilis develops. - Therefore specific treponemal tests have no specificity for neurosyphilis.

{"question": "A 42-year-old man presents to his doctor with complaints of left-sided flank pain radiating into his groin. The pain began suddenly and has increased in intensity. He had a similar problem several years ago, but he did not seek medical attention, and his symptoms resolved spontaneously. He denies fever, chills, nausea, or vomiting. He has had no diarrhea or difficulty urinating. Physical examination is remarkable for tenderness along the left flank and into the groin, but is otherwise normal. There are no inguinal hernias detected on examination. A urinalysis reveals microscopic hematuria without casts. Serum chemistry reveals: Sodium: 143 mEq/L Potassium: 2.4 mEq/L Bicarbonate: 17 mEq/L Chloride: 115 mEq/L Blood urea nitrogen: 12 mg/dL Creatinine: 1.0 mg/dL Glucose: 85 mg/dL Which of the following is MOST likely present in this patient?", "exp": "This patient's bicarbonate is lower than the normal range of 22-28 mEq/L. This means that there is less bicarbonate in his blood than usual. If his breathing is normal, then his CO2 level should be about normal. Bicarbonate is produced when CO2 binds to an H2O molecule, which then splits into a H+ ion and a HCO3- (bicarbonate) ion. This reaction is governed by an equilibrium constant propoional to the concentrations of the products multiplied together over the concentrations of the reactants multiplied together. By convention, the \"water\" concentration is ignored because it is \"constant.\" So, in order for the equilibrium constant to not change value, the H+ concentration must increase if the bicarbonate decreases and the CO2 remains the same. This means that an acidosis is produced. In this case, it is a metabolic acidosis, since there is no indication of respiratory disease in this patient. Neither a normal acid-base status nor a metabolic alkalosis would have a low bicarbonate. Note: The hallmark of metabolic acidosis is decreased HCO3-. Metabolic acidosis are classified by the anion gap, either normal or increased. The anion gap is the difference between readily measured anions and cations. Ref: Cho K.C. (2013). Chapter 21.

Physical examination is remarkable for swelling and erythema of the right great toe as well as small nodules on the patient's external ear. Aspiration of the metatarsal-phalangeal joint of the affected toe demonstrates needle-shaped negatively birefringent crystals. Which of the following agents would provide the most immediate relief for this patient?", "exp": "The patient has gout, which is due to precipitation of monosodium urate crystals in joint spaces (notably the great toe) and soft tissues (causing tophi, which are often found on the external ears). Colchicine reduces the inflammation caused by the urate crystals by inhibiting leukocyte migration and phagocytosis secondary to an effect on microtubule assembly. Allopurinol and its metabolite, oxypurinol, inhibit xanthine oxidase, the enzyme that forms uric acid from hypoxanthine. Therapy with this agent should be begun 1-2 weeks after the acute attack has subsided. Aspirin competes with uric acid for tubular secretion, thereby decreasing urinary urate excretion and raising serum uric acid levels. At high doses (more than 2 gm daily) aspirin is a uricosuric. Probenecid and sulfinpyrazone are uricosuric agents, increasing the urinary excretion of uric acid, hence decreasing serum levels of the substance.

Malignant otitis externa is a disorder involving inflammation and damage of the bones and cartilage at the base of skull in temporal bone as a result of spread of infection from outer ear.* Malignant otitis externa is often caused by difficult to treat bacteria such as pseudomonas aeruginosa. Only rare cases of malignant otitis externa due to S. aureus, Proteus mirabilis and Aspergillus fumigatus have been reported. The infection spreads from the floor of the ear canal to the nearby tissues and into the bones at the base of the skull. The infection and inflammation may damage or destroy the bones. The infection may spread more and affect the cranial nerves, brain, or other parts of the body.Predisposing factors for malignant otitis externa* Elderly diabetics (most common predisposing factor)* Individuals with altered immune function (immunodeficiency)* ChemotherapyClinical features of malignant otitis externa* Severe pain inside the ear and may get worse when moving head.* Granulation tissue in the external auditory canal, at the junction of bony and cartilagenous part.* Drainage from the ear - yellow, yellow - green, foul smelling, persistent.* Fever* Itching of ear or ear canal* Troubled swallowing & weakness of face.Complications* Cranial nerve palsies most commonly facial nerve is involved.
